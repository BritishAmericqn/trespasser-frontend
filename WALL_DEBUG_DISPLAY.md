# Wall Debug Display

## What's Changed

1. **Removed Console Spam**: No more constant "DESTRUCTION: Updating walls from game state" messages
2. **Removed Unnecessary Debug Keys**: D (client prediction) and S (server sync) are gone
3. **Replaced Control List**: The left side now shows real-time wall health status

## New Wall Debug Display

The left side of the screen now shows:

### ðŸ§± WALL STATUS:
Each wall displays:
- **Wall ID** (e.g., wall_1, wall_2, etc.)
- **Health Bar**: Visual representation using colored blocks
  - ðŸŸ© Green = 70%+ health
  - ðŸŸ¨ Yellow = 30-70% health
  - ðŸŸ¥ Red = 1-30% health
  - â¬› Black = Destroyed
- **Health Percentage**: Exact health remaining
- **Status**: âœ… ACTIVE or ðŸ’€ DESTROYED

### Damaged Slices
When a wall slice takes damage, it shows:
```
wall_1: ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ 75% âœ… ACTIVE
  â””â”€ Slice 2: 75/100
```

### ðŸŽ¯ WEAPON DAMAGE:
Quick reference for weapon damage values:
- Rifle: 25
- Pistol: 35
- Grenade: 100
- Rocket: 150

## How to Use

1. **Shoot walls** - Watch the health bars update in real-time
2. **Check slice damage** - See which parts of walls are damaged
3. **Verify sync** - Both client and server damage should match
4. **Test destruction** - Walls should show ðŸ’€ DESTROYED when health reaches 0

## Testing Wall Destruction

1. **Rifle**: Takes 20 shots to destroy a full wall (500 HP)
2. **Pistol**: Takes 15 shots
3. **Grenade**: Takes 5 hits
4. **Rocket**: Takes 4 hits

The debug display updates every frame, showing you exactly what's happening with wall health on both client and server sides.
