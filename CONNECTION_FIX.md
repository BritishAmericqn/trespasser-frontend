# ðŸ”§ Connection Fix - Walls Not Loading

## The Problem
Backend IS sending `game:state` with 79 walls (visible in console as "BACKEND EVENT: game:state - 79 walls") but:
- Walls not rendering (0 wall slices)
- "Wall not found" errors
- Game not playable

## Root Cause
**Scenes were removing NetworkSystem's `game:state` listener!**

When LobbyWaitingScene, MatchmakingScene, or ConfigureScene shutdown, they were calling:
```javascript
socket.off('game:state')
```

This removed the GLOBAL `game:state` listener that NetworkSystem had set up, breaking the entire event flow.

## The Fix Applied

### 1. Stop Scenes from Removing NetworkSystem's Listener
```javascript
// OLD (in shutdown methods):
socket.off('game:state');

// NEW:
// Don't remove game:state - that's owned by NetworkSystem
```

Fixed in:
- ConfigureScene.ts
- MatchmakingScene.ts  
- LobbyWaitingScene.ts

### 2. Architecture Issues Found

**Multiple listeners for same event:**
- NetworkSystem sets up the main `game:state` listener
- LobbyWaitingScene also listens to `game:state`
- MatchmakingScene also listens to `game:state`
- ConfigureScene also listens to `game:state`

This creates conflicts and race conditions.

## Event Flow (How it Should Work)

```
Backend sends 'game:state'
    â†“
NetworkSystem receives it (ONLY listener)
    â†“
NetworkSystem forwards to GameScene
    â†“
GameScene emits 'network:gameState'
    â†“
DestructionRenderer processes walls
    â†“
Walls render
```

## What Was Happening

```
Backend sends 'game:state'
    â†“
Multiple scenes listen to it
    â†“
Scene transitions and calls socket.off('game:state')
    â†“
NetworkSystem's listener is REMOVED
    â†“
No more game:state events processed
    â†“
No walls, no game
```

## Testing

After this fix:
1. Reload the page
2. Start a game
3. You should see in console:
   - "ðŸ“¨ Game State Received:" with wall count
   - "âœ… Forwarding game state to GameScene"
   - "ðŸ“Š Processing game state"
   - "ðŸ§± DestructionRenderer processing 79 walls"
4. Walls should render and game should be playable

## Next Steps

Should refactor to have ONLY NetworkSystem listen to socket events and use Phaser's event system for internal communication. Scenes should never directly listen to socket events.
