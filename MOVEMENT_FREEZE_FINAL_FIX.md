# üîß Movement Freeze Final Fix

## Status Update

We've fixed several issues but movement still causes freezing. Here's what we've addressed so far:

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues:

1. **Canvas Performance Warning** - Added `willReadFrequently: true` to DestructionRenderer
2. **Wall Update Optimization** - Only updating walls every 10 frames instead of every frame
3. **ConfigureScene Update Spam** - Reduced NetworkSystem checks to once per second
4. **LobbyStateManager Cleanup** - Properly clearing and destroying on game start

### üîç Remaining Issues to Investigate:

1. **Memory Leak in Event Listeners**
   - Check if socket listeners are accumulating
   - Verify scene cleanup is complete

2. **Client Prediction System**
   - Input buffer might be growing too large
   - Check for expensive collision calculations

3. **Vision Renderer**
   - Creating/destroying graphics objects every frame
   - RenderTexture operations might be expensive

4. **Player Manager**
   - Check if player sprites are being recreated
   - Verify proper cleanup of old player data

5. **Scene Overlap**
   - Previous scenes might still be running in background
   - Check if update loops are stacking

## Next Steps:

1. Add more specific logging around freeze point
2. Profile memory usage during movement
3. Check for accumulating event listeners
4. Verify all scenes are properly stopped

## Key Observation:

The freeze happens specifically when:
- Player starts moving (not just looking around)
- After some time passes
- Works fine in private server mode (simpler flow)

This suggests the issue is related to:
- Something that accumulates over time
- Something specific to the matchmaking flow
- Something triggered by movement input
