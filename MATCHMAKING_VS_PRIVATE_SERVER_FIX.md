# ðŸ”§ Matchmaking vs Private Server Fix

## Problem Summary

The game works fine in **private server mode** but freezes when moving in **matchmaking mode**. The root causes were:

1. **ConfigureScene Update Spam** - NetworkSystemSingleton was being called every frame
2. **LobbyStateManager Interference** - Still trying to update destroyed UI elements after game starts
3. **Scene Cleanup Issues** - Scenes not properly unsubscribing from state managers

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ConfigureScene Update Spam

**Problem:**
```typescript
// OLD - Called every frame!
update(): void {
  this.updateStartGameButton(); // This calls NetworkSystemSingleton.getInstance() 60x/second
}
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
// NEW - Only check once per second
private lastConnectionCheck = 0;

update(): void {
  const now = Date.now();
  if (now - this.lastConnectionCheck > 1000) {
    this.lastConnectionCheck = now;
    this.updateStartGameButton();
  }
}
```

### 2. LobbyStateManager Still Active in Game

**Problem:**
- When match starts, LobbyStateManager continues to receive updates
- It tries to notify listeners in destroyed scenes
- This causes "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'drawImage')" errors

**Fix:**
```typescript
// In LobbyStateManager
this.socket.on('match_started', (data: any) => {
  console.log('ðŸš€ Match started:', data);
  this.updateFromPartial({
    status: 'in_progress'
  });
  // Clear state after transition
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('ðŸŽ® Match started, clearing lobby state');
    this.clearState();
  }, 100);
});
```

### 3. Why Private Server Works

In private server mode:
- GameScene creates its own lobby directly
- Bypasses LobbyStateManager entirely
- No lingering state managers trying to update destroyed scenes

In matchmaking mode:
- Goes through MatchmakingScene â†’ LobbyWaitingScene â†’ GameScene
- LobbyStateManager remains active throughout
- Continues receiving updates even after scenes are destroyed

## Additional Fixes Needed

### Scene Cleanup
Scenes should properly unsubscribe from LobbyStateManager in their shutdown:
```typescript
shutdown(): void {
  // Existing cleanup...
  
  // Also clear LobbyStateManager if in game
  if (this.scene.key === 'GameScene') {
    const lsm = LobbyStateManager.getInstance();
    lsm.clearState();
  }
}
```

## Testing

1. **Test Matchmaking Flow:**
   - Join via "INSTANT PLAY"
   - Move around when game starts
   - Should NOT freeze anymore

2. **Test Private Server:**
   - Should continue working as before

3. **Check Console:**
   - No more ConfigureScene update spam
   - No more drawImage errors
   - Clean transition messages

## Key Insight

The freeze wasn't actually in the game logic - it was caused by destroyed UI elements still trying to render via LobbyStateManager notifications. By clearing the lobby state when the match starts, we prevent these phantom updates.
