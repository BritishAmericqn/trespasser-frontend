# 🧪 Backend Integration Test

## 🎯 **Testing Backend Claims**

The backend team claims they ARE sending wall damage events. Let's test this immediately.

## 🔍 **Enhanced Debug Mode**

I've added enhanced logging to confirm what the backend is actually sending:

### **Enhanced NetworkSystem Logging**
```javascript
// This will show ALL backend events
this.socket.onAny((eventName, data) => {
  if (eventName.includes('weapon') || eventName.includes('wall') || eventName.includes('explosion') || eventName.includes('hit')) {
    console.log(`🔥 BACKEND EVENT RECEIVED: ${eventName}`, data);
  }
});

// Enhanced wall event logging
this.socket.on('wall:damaged', (data) => {
  console.log('🧱 Backend wall:damaged event received:', data);
  this.scene.events.emit('backend:wall:damaged', data);
});
```

## 📋 **Test Procedure**

### **Step 1: Test Backend Events**
1. **Fire a weapon** (any weapon)
2. **Look for these console messages:**
   - `🔥 BACKEND EVENT RECEIVED: weapon:fired`
   - `🔥 BACKEND EVENT RECEIVED: weapon:hit`
   - `🔥 BACKEND EVENT RECEIVED: wall:damaged`
   - `🧱 Backend wall:damaged event received:`

### **Step 2: Test Wall Damage Processing**
1. **If you see `🧱 Backend wall:damaged event received:`**
   - Look for: `🧱 DESTRUCTION: Processing wall:damaged event`
   - Look for: `🧱 Wall wall_1 slice 2 damaged: 75 health`

### **Step 3: Test Visual Updates**
1. **If processing messages appear**
   - Walls should get darker/show cracks
   - Effects count should show wall damage

## 🧪 **Expected Results**

### **If Backend is Correct:**
```
🔥 BACKEND EVENT RECEIVED: weapon:fired
🔥 BACKEND EVENT RECEIVED: wall:damaged
🧱 Backend wall:damaged event received: { wallId: 'wall_1', damage: 25, newHealth: 75 }
🧱 DESTRUCTION: Processing wall:damaged event
🧱 Wall wall_1 slice 2 damaged: 75 health
```

### **If Backend is Wrong:**
```
🔥 BACKEND EVENT RECEIVED: weapon:fired
(No wall:damaged events)
```

## 🎯 **Immediate Action**

**Fire a weapon and check console NOW.**

### **If You See Wall Events:**
- Backend is correct ✅
- Issue is in DestructionRenderer/VisualEffectsSystem
- Need to fix visual processing

### **If You DON'T See Wall Events:**
- Backend is not sending them ❌
- Backend needs to implement wall damage system
- Original assessment was correct

## 📞 **Report Results**

Please fire a weapon and immediately report what console messages you see!
