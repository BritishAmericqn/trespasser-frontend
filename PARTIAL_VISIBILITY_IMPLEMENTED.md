# Partial Player Visibility - Implementation Complete âœ…

## What Was Implemented

The frontend now supports **partial player occlusion** using Phaser 3's geometry masks. This means enemy players will only show the parts visible within your vision polygon, creating realistic line-of-sight gameplay.

### Key Features:
- ðŸŽ¯ **Precise Clipping**: Only visible parts of enemy players render
- ðŸŽ® **Gameplay Ready**: Players can peek around corners and use cover effectively
- âš¡ **Performance Optimized**: Uses GPU-accelerated geometry masks
- ðŸ”§ **Debug Toggle**: Press 'Y' to enable/disable for testing
- ðŸŽ­ **Immersive Design**: No health bars or name tags - pure tactical gameplay

## How It Works

1. **Vision Polygon** from backend defines what you can see
2. **Geometry Mask** clips enemy player sprites to only show visible parts
3. **Local Player** always renders fully (no self-masking)
4. **Dynamic Updates** as you move and rotate

### Visual Feedback (Minimal for Immersion)
- **Team Colors**: Red vs Blue players
- **Direction Indicator**: Small white triangle shows facing direction
- **Health State**: Subtle transparency when critically injured
- **Last Seen**: Very faint ghost marker where enemies disappeared

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the Game
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Partial Visibility
- Have **2+ players** connected
- Position one player behind a wall edge
- The other player should see only the exposed parts

### 3. Debug Controls
- **Press 'Y'**: Toggle partial visibility on/off
- **Press 'V'**: Show vision polygon overlay
- **Press 'P'**: Test polygon vision manually

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. **VisionRenderer.ts**
   - Added `getCurrentPolygon()` method to expose vision data

2. **PlayerManager.ts**
   - Added geometry mask support to player sprites
   - `updateVisibilityMasks()` applies polygon clipping
   - Masks update dynamically with vision changes
   - Proper cleanup on player removal

3. **GameScene.ts**
   - Connected VisionRenderer to PlayerManager
   - Added debug toggle key (Y)

### Technical Approach:
```javascript
// For each enemy player:
1. Create graphics object with vision polygon
2. Convert to geometry mask
3. Apply mask to player container
4. Only pixels inside polygon render
```

## Next Steps

### Optimization Opportunities:
1. **Mask Caching**: Reuse masks when polygon hasn't changed
2. **Spatial Culling**: Skip masking for players far from edges
3. **LOD System**: Simplify distant player rendering

### Visual Enhancements:
1. **Soft Edges**: Add gradient fade at clip boundaries
2. **Shadow Hints**: Show subtle indicators of hidden players
3. **Visibility Particles**: Add effects when players appear/disappear

## Troubleshooting

**Players fully visible when they shouldn't be?**
- Check backend is sending polygon vision data
- Press 'V' to verify vision polygon is active
- Ensure 'Y' toggle is enabled

**Performance issues?**
- Reduce vision polygon complexity
- Implement spatial culling
- Consider WebGL renderer if using Canvas

**Visual artifacts?**
- Update Phaser to latest version
- Check polygon winding order
- Verify no self-intersecting polygons
