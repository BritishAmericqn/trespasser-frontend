# ðŸŽ¨ SMOKE GRENADE VISUAL IMPROVEMENTS

## WHAT'S NEW

### Enhanced Circular Smoke Effect
1. **Perfect Circular Clouds** âœ…
   - Multi-layered circular rendering (5 layers)
   - Each layer has different opacity and size
   - Creates depth and volume effect

2. **Smooth Animations** âœ…
   - Rotating layers create swirling effect
   - Wispy edges that pulse and rotate
   - Particles drift with circular motion
   - Easing function for smooth expansion

3. **15-Second Duration** âœ…
   - Extended from 8 to 15 seconds
   - Fade in during first second
   - Stable opacity for ~11 seconds
   - Fade out during last 3 seconds

### Visual Features

#### Layered Smoke Cloud
- **5 concentric circles** with varying opacity
- Inner layers darker and denser
- Outer layers lighter and more transparent
- Each layer rotates at different speeds

#### Animated Wisps
- **6 wispy circles** around the edge
- Pulsing size animation
- Rotating around the smoke center
- Creates organic, living smoke effect

#### Improved Particles
- **15 particles** per smoke zone (up from 10)
- Circular drift pattern with turbulence
- Slight upward bias (smoke rises)
- Particles respawn when they drift too far
- Smooth growth over time

### Technical Improvements

```javascript
// Smooth easing for expansion
easeOutCubic(t) = 1 - Math.pow(1 - t, 3)

// Multi-layer rendering
for (layer = 0 to 5) {
  opacity = base * (0.3 + layer * 0.14)
  radius = base * (1 + layer * 0.08)
  rotation = time * (1 + layer * 0.2)
}

// Animated wisps
for (wisp = 0 to 6) {
  angle = (2Ï€ * i/6) + time
  sizePulse = 1 + sin(time + i) * 0.1
}
```

## VISUAL CHARACTERISTICS

### Color Palette
- **Main smoke**: #808080 to #C0C0C0
- **Wisps**: #AAAAAA
- **Particles**: #B8B8B8
- Gradual gradient from center to edge

### Animation Timing
- **Expansion**: 2 seconds (smooth cubic easing)
- **Rotation**: 0.0005 radians/ms (slow swirl)
- **Wisp pulse**: 0.002 radians/ms
- **Particle drift**: 0.2 pixels/frame

### Opacity Stages
1. **0-1 second**: Fade in from 0% to 90%
2. **1-12 seconds**: Stable at 90% opacity
3. **12-15 seconds**: Fade out to 0%

## TESTING THE VISUALS

### What to Look For
1. **Circular shape** - Should be perfectly round
2. **Smooth expansion** - No jerky growth
3. **Swirling motion** - Subtle rotation of layers
4. **Wispy edges** - Organic, cloud-like perimeter
5. **Particle drift** - Natural smoke movement
6. **15-second lifetime** - Full duration before disappearing

### Console Commands (if debug enabled)
```javascript
// Check smoke zone data
console.log(gameState.smokeZones)

// Verify duration
smokeZones.forEach(s => console.log(s.duration))
```

## BACKEND NOTES

The frontend now expects:
- `smoke.duration` = 15000 (milliseconds)
- `smoke.maxRadius` = 60 (pixels)
- `smoke.expansionTime` = 2000 (milliseconds)

If backend sends different values, the frontend will use them but defaults to 15 seconds.

## PERFORMANCE

### Optimizations
- Graphics are cleared and redrawn each frame
- Particles respawn instead of creating new ones
- Layer count limited to 5 for performance
- Wisp count limited to 6

### Frame Rate Impact
- Minimal impact with 1-2 smoke zones
- May see slight drop with 5+ simultaneous zones
- Particles are the main performance cost

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

### Potential Improvements
1. **Wind effects** - Drift smoke in wind direction
2. **Color variations** - Different smoke colors for teams
3. **Density variations** - Thicker/thinner smoke options
4. **Interaction** - Smoke disperses when players move through
5. **Lighting effects** - Smoke affected by nearby explosions

### Shader Options
- Could use WebGL shaders for better performance
- Volumetric smoke with depth
- Real-time blur and distortion

---

The smoke now looks much more realistic with smooth circular clouds, subtle animations, and a full 15-second duration. The multi-layered approach creates depth while the animated wisps and particles add life to the effect.
