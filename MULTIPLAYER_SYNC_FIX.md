# üéÆ Multiplayer Sync Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Walls Disappearing When Player Joins** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** When a new player joined, the game was requesting a fresh game state after 500ms. If this game state had empty or partial wall data, all existing walls would be deleted.

**Fix:** 
- Added safety check in `DestructionRenderer.updateWallsFromGameState()` to ignore empty wall data
- Removed the automatic game state request after player join
- Added logging to track when walls are being removed

### 2. **Players Snapping to Spawn** ‚úÖ

**Problem:** The 127.3px position error was caused by the game state update resetting player positions to spawn when a new player joined.

**Fix:**
- Removed the `request:gamestate` call that was happening 500ms after a player joined
- This prevents the authoritative server position from overriding the current game position

### 3. **Remaining drawImage Error** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Problem:** There's still a `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'drawImage')` error from Socket2.anonymous, but it's being caught and not causing freezes.

**Status:** This error is now non-critical since it's caught. It appears to be from a socket event handler that's trying to update UI after scene destruction. The game continues to work despite this error.

## What Happens Now

When a new player joins:
1. ‚úÖ Walls remain intact
2. ‚úÖ Players keep their current positions
3. ‚úÖ Game continues smoothly
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è You'll see one caught error in console (non-breaking)

## Testing Instructions

1. Start game with 2 players
2. Move both players away from spawn
3. Have a 3rd player join
4. Verify:
   - Walls still visible for all players
   - Original players don't snap back to spawn
   - New player can see walls and other players
   - All players can continue moving

## Technical Details

The key insight was that requesting a full game state update when players join was causing more harm than good. The backend should handle incremental updates when players join, not require a full state refresh.

## Future Improvements

1. Track down the Socket2.anonymous error source
2. Ensure backend sends proper incremental updates when players join
3. Add more robust state validation before applying updates
