# 🌫️ Fog of War Vision System - Implementation Complete

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **VisionRenderer** (`src/client/systems/VisionRenderer.ts`)
- ✅ Fog overlay that covers non-visible areas
- ✅ Main vision cone: 120° forward arc, 100px range
- ✅ Peripheral vision: 30px radius circle
- ✅ Blind spot: 90° cone behind player
- ✅ Extended mouse vision: 30° cone, 130px range in mouse direction
- ✅ Debug visualization mode (press 'V' to toggle)
- ✅ Performance optimization: Only updates when player moves >2px or rotates >5°

### 2. **PlayerManager** (`src/client/systems/PlayerManager.ts`)
- ✅ Handles visible/invisible player transitions
- ✅ Smooth fade-in when players appear (200ms)
- ✅ Smooth fade-out when players disappear (300ms)
- ✅ Ghost markers for last seen positions
- ✅ Ghost persistence for 2 seconds, then 1 second fade
- ✅ Team colors: Red vs Blue
- ✅ Health bars above players
- ✅ Direction indicators
- ✅ Player names (last 4 chars of ID)

### 3. **InterpolationSystem** (`src/client/systems/InterpolationSystem.ts`)
- ✅ Smooth position interpolation between network updates
- ✅ Angle interpolation with proper wrapping
- ✅ Configurable smoothing factor

### 4. **GameScene Integration**
- ✅ Vision system initialization
- ✅ Player manager for multiplayer rendering
- ✅ Game state handling for filtered visibility
- ✅ Collision event handling with visual feedback
- ✅ Debug key bindings

### 5. **Type Updates** (`shared/types/index.ts`)
- ✅ Extended PlayerState with angle, weaponType, movementState
- ✅ Added WallState, ProjectileState interfaces
- ✅ GameState now supports filtered visibility data
- ✅ CollisionEvent interface for position corrections

## 🎮 How to Use

### Controls
- **V** - Toggle vision debug mode (shows vision cones and ranges)
- **WASD** - Move around to see fog of war update
- **Mouse** - Aim to see extended vision cone in mouse direction

### Testing the System

1. **Single Player Testing**
   - Run the game and move around
   - Press 'V' to see vision debug overlay
   - Notice how fog reveals/conceals areas as you move
   - Turn around to see the blind spot behind you

2. **Multiplayer Testing**
   - Open two browser tabs with the game
   - Move players to see each other
   - Turn one player away - the other should disappear into fog
   - Move behind walls to block vision
   - Watch for ghost markers when players disappear

## 🔧 Backend Integration

The system expects these events from the backend:

```typescript
// Filtered game state (every 50ms)
{
  visiblePlayers: PlayerState[],     // Only players you can see
  recentlyVisiblePlayers: [...],     // Optional: Recently seen
  walls: WallState[],                 // All walls
  projectiles: ProjectileState[],     // Visible projectiles
  timestamp: number,
  tickRate: number
}

// Collision events
{
  playerId: string,
  position: Vector2,      // Corrected position
  velocity: Vector2       // Updated velocity
}
```

## 🎨 Visual Features

### Fog Appearance
- **Dark overlay** (85% opacity black) for non-visible areas
- **Smooth edges** using geometry masks
- **Real-time updates** as player moves/rotates

### Player Rendering
- **Team colors**: Red (#ff4444) vs Blue (#4444ff)
- **Health bars**: Green/Yellow/Red based on health
- **Direction indicator**: White triangle showing facing
- **Ghost markers**: Gray outline with "?" when player disappears
- **Footprint icons**: Simple circles below ghost markers

### Debug Visualization (Press 'V')
- **Red outline**: Main 120° vision cone
- **Green circle**: 30px peripheral vision
- **Dark red cone**: 90° blind spot behind player
- **Blue cone**: 30° extended mouse vision
- **White line**: Player facing direction

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Conditional Updates**: Vision only recalculates on significant movement
2. **Render Texture**: Fog uses cached render texture, not per-frame drawing
3. **Object Pooling**: Could be added for player sprites if needed
4. **Geometry Masks**: Hardware-accelerated masking for fog

## 📝 Next Steps & Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Wall Occlusion**: Add raycasting to block vision through walls
2. **Sound Indicators**: Show audio cues for non-visible events
3. **Smooth Fog Edges**: Add gradient or dithering at vision boundaries
4. **Performance Monitor**: Add FPS counter when many players visible
5. **Custom Shaders**: Use WebGL shaders for smoother fog transitions

### Known Limitations
1. Wall occlusion not yet implemented (backend should handle this)
2. No raycasting on frontend (relies on backend filtering)
3. Ghost markers are simple - could be enhanced with more info
4. No minimap integration yet

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Fog Not Appearing?
- Check if VisionRenderer is initialized in GameScene
- Verify fog texture depth (should be 90)
- Press 'V' to enable debug mode

### Players Not Appearing?
- Check backend is sending visiblePlayers array
- Verify PlayerManager is receiving game state updates
- Check console for connection status

### Performance Issues?
- Reduce vision update frequency in VisionRenderer
- Disable debug visualization
- Check number of active tweens for fade animations

## ✨ Summary

The fog of war system is now fully implemented and ready for use. It provides:
- Server-authoritative visibility (backend filters, frontend renders)
- Smooth visual transitions for appearing/disappearing players
- Tactical ghost markers for recently seen enemies
- Debug tools for development and testing
- Performance-optimized rendering

The system follows the principle: **"Backend decides WHAT you see, frontend decides HOW you see it."**
