# Team Sprite Rendering Fix Summary

## Problem
Blue team players were appearing as red to themselves and sometimes to other players due to missing team data from the backend.

## Root Cause
The backend is not consistently sending team data in the `visiblePlayers` array of the game state updates. When team data is missing, the frontend defaulted all players to blue team.

## Data Flow Analysis

```
Player Flow:
1. Player selects team in ConfigureScene ✅
2. Team stored in loadout (game.registry) ✅
3. GameScene creates local player sprite with correct color ✅
4. Player joins match (sends loadout to backend) ✅
5. Backend stores player data ❓
6. Backend sends game state WITHOUT team data ❌
7. PlayerManager defaults missing teams to blue ❌
8. Incorrect team colors displayed ❌
```

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Team Detection in PlayerManager** [[memory:3589549]]
The PlayerManager now uses multiple fallback strategies to determine player teams:

**Priority Order:**
1. Direct team field from backend
2. Cached team from previous updates
3. Team from player loadout data
4. Inferred from spawn position (temporary workaround)
5. Default to blue (last resort)

### 2. **Team Caching System**
Added a `playerTeamCache` Map to remember player teams even when the backend doesn't send them consistently.

### 3. **Improved Logging**
Added detailed logging to track when team data is missing and what fallback was used.

## Code Changes

### PlayerManager.ts
- Added `playerTeamCache: Map<string, 'red' | 'blue'>` to cache player teams
- Enhanced `createPlayerSprite()` with multiple team detection strategies
- Updated `removePlayer()` to clean up team cache

### GameScene.ts
- Added warning logs when backend is missing team data
- Enhanced player join handling to preserve loadout data
- Improved debug logging for team assignments

## Testing Instructions

### What to Look For:
1. **Console Logs**: Watch for these messages:
   - `🎨 Creating sprite for player X with team: Y` - Shows team assignment
   - `📋 Using cached team for player X: Y` - Using cached data
   - `⚠️ Player X missing team data, inferring Y from position` - Fallback used
   - `⚠️ Backend missing team data for player X` - Backend issue detected

2. **Visual Testing**:
   - Select red team → Should appear red to yourself
   - Select blue team → Should appear blue to yourself
   - Other players should see correct colors
   - Late-joining players should see correct colors

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test with multiple players on different teams
   - Test late joins
   - Test after respawning
   - Test with players on both teams

## Backend Requirements

The backend MUST include team data in:
1. `gameState.visiblePlayers[].team`
2. `gameState.players[].team`
3. Player join events
4. Player state updates

See `BACKEND_TEAM_COLOR_REQUIREMENTS.md` for full backend specifications.

## Temporary Workarounds

Until the backend is fixed, the system will:
1. Cache teams when they are provided
2. Use loadout data as backup
3. Infer team from spawn position (red spawns left, blue spawns right)

## Status
✅ Frontend fixes implemented
⏳ Waiting for backend to provide consistent team data
🔧 Temporary workarounds in place
