# Vercel Build Fix - TypeScript Compilation Error

## Issue
Build failed on Vercel with TypeScript error:
```
src/client/systems/PlayerManager.ts(83,10): error TS2339: Property 'playerTeamCache' does not exist on type 'PlayerManager'
src/client/systems/PlayerManager.ts(283,12): error TS2339: Property 'playerTeamCache' does not exist on type 'PlayerManager'
```

## Root Cause
The `playerTeamCache` Map was being used in the code but was never declared as a class property.

## Fix Applied
Added the missing property declaration to the PlayerManager class:
```typescript
private playerTeamCache: Map<string, 'red' | 'blue'> = new Map();
```

Also improved the team detection logic to:
1. Check direct team field from state
2. Check loadout team data
3. **Check cached team from previous updates** (new)
4. Infer from spawn position
5. Default to 'blue'

The cache now stores team data when a player sprite is created and updates when team changes are detected.

## Verification
- ✅ Build passes locally with `npm run build`
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Team caching improves consistency of team colors

## Ready to Deploy
The fix has been committed. You can now push to Vercel and the build should succeed.
