# 🧪 Debug Match End Testing Guide

## Overview

I've added debug controls to test the match end flow without having to actually play to 50 kills. This allows you to verify that all the fixes and improvements are working properly.

## Debug Controls (Development Only)

When running in development mode, you'll see a **yellow pulsing debug panel** in the bottom-left corner of the game showing:

```
🧪 DEBUG CONTROLS
M - Test match end (50 kills)
N - Simulate backend event
F - Toggle fog of war
```

## Testing Options

### Option 1: Test Client-Side Flow (M Key)

Press **M** to simulate reaching 50 kills through client-side detection:

1. Creates fake game state with players
2. RED team gets 50 kills (35 + 15)
3. BLUE team gets 38 kills (20 + 18)
4. Updates kill counter display
5. Directly calls `handleMatchEnd()`

**What to expect:**
- Kill counter shows "RED: 50/50, BLUE: 38/50"
- Console: `🧪 DEBUG: Simulating 50 kills for RED team`
- Console: `🧪 DEBUG: Directly calling handleMatchEnd`
- Transition to MatchResultsScene

### Option 2: Test Backend Event (N Key)

Press **N** to simulate the backend sending a `match_ended` event:

1. Creates realistic match data
2. Includes 6 players with varied stats
3. Simulates 5-minute match duration
4. Triggers the backend event handler

**What to expect:**
- Console: `🧪 DEBUG: Simulating backend match_ended event`
- Console: `🏁 Match ended event received`
- Console: `🧹 Cleaning up for match end transition`
- Smooth transition to MatchResultsScene
- Results show RED wins 50-47

## What to Verify

### During Testing:

1. **No Duplicate Transitions**
   - Press M or N multiple times quickly
   - Should see: `⚠️ Already handling match end, ignoring duplicate`
   - Only one transition should occur

2. **Clean State Management**
   - Input stops working (spectator mode)
   - Death screen clears if visible
   - Visual effects stop
   - No errors in console

3. **Match Results Display**
   - Victory banner shows correct winner
   - Player stats display properly
   - Buttons work (Play Again / Menu)
   - 30-second countdown timer starts

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Die then press M/N - death screen should clear
   - Press M/N during respawn - should handle gracefully
   - Press M/N rapidly - no duplicates

## Console Output to Expect

### Successful Test (N key):
```
🧪 DEBUG: Simulating backend match_ended event
🧪 DEBUG: Calling matchEndedHandler with fake data
🏁 Match ended event received: {winnerTeam: "red", ...}
🧹 Cleaning up for match end transition
✅ Input system set to spectator mode
✅ Vision updates paused
🎬 Transitioning from GameScene to MatchResultsScene
```

### Successful Test (M key):
```
🧪 DEBUG: Simulating 50 kills for RED team
🧪 DEBUG: Updating kill counter with test data
📊 KILL TOTALS - RED: 50, BLUE: 38
🧪 DEBUG: Directly calling handleMatchEnd
🏁 Client-side match end detected!
```

## Important Notes

1. **Development Only** - These debug controls only work in development mode
2. **Production Safety** - The `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` check ensures this code won't run in production
3. **Real Testing** - Also test with actual gameplay to ensure backend integration works

## Recent Fixes

### Fixed Freeze Issue (M Key)
- **Problem**: Game was freezing when pressing M due to missing `playerName` fields
- **Solution**: Added proper player names to debug data
- **Result**: Now transitions smoothly to MatchResultsScene

### Fixed Data Structure
- **Problem**: MatchResultsScene expected `playerStats` array with specific fields
- **Solution**: Ensured all required fields (`playerId`, `playerName`, `team`, `kills`, `deaths`, `damageDealt`) are included
- **Result**: Scoreboard displays properly with all player statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Panel Not Showing?
- Check if you're in development mode
- Look for console error about `process.env.NODE_ENV`

### M Key Not Working?
- Client-side detection is currently commented out
- Directly calls `handleMatchEnd()` instead
- Check console for debug messages

### N Key Not Working?
- Verify match lifecycle listeners are set up
- Check for `matchEndedHandler not found` error
- Ensure you're in GameScene

### No Transition?
- Check `isMatchEnding` flag isn't stuck
- Verify MatchResultsScene exists
- Look for SceneManager errors

## Summary

These debug controls let you quickly test that:
- ✅ Match end detection works
- ✅ Duplicate prevention works
- ✅ State cleanup works
- ✅ Scene transitions work
- ✅ Results display works
- ✅ All the lessons from respawn issues are properly applied

Press **M** or **N** in game to test the complete match end flow!
