# ✅ Fixed: Second Death Screen Disappearing

## Problem
When dying a **second time**, the death screen would appear but immediately disappear after 1 second.

## Root Cause
The **10-second emergency respawn timer from the FIRST death was still running** and would trigger during the second death, forcing an immediate respawn.

### Timeline of Bug:
1. **First Death (0s):** Creates 10-second emergency timer
2. **First Respawn (5s):** Player respawns but timer NOT cancelled  
3. **Second Death (8s):** Death screen appears
4. **Old Timer Fires (10s):** "EMERGENCY: 10 seconds elapsed" triggers
5. **Death Screen Removed:** Forced respawn cleans up death screen

---

## Solution Applied

### 1. Track Emergency Timer
```javascript
// Added to class properties
private emergencyRespawnTimer: Phaser.Time.TimerEvent | null = null;
```

### 2. Cancel Old Timer Before Creating New One
```javascript
// In handleLocalPlayerDeath()
if (this.emergencyRespawnTimer) {
  console.log('🧹 Cancelling previous emergency respawn timer');
  this.emergencyRespawnTimer.destroy();
  this.emergencyRespawnTimer = null;
}
// Then create new timer...
```

### 3. Cancel Timer on Respawn
```javascript
// In handleLocalPlayerRespawn()
if (this.emergencyRespawnTimer) {
  console.log('🧹 Cancelling emergency respawn timer on respawn');
  this.emergencyRespawnTimer.destroy();
  this.emergencyRespawnTimer = null;
}
```

### 4. Clean Up in All Cases
- Added cleanup in `forceCleanupDeathState()`
- Added cleanup in `shutdown()` when scene ends

---

## Expected Behavior Now

### First Death:
1. Death screen appears
2. 5-second countdown
3. Auto-respawn or manual respawn
4. **Timer properly cancelled**

### Second Death:
1. Death screen appears
2. **Stays visible** (no old timer to interfere)
3. 5-second countdown works normally
4. Auto-respawn or manual respawn

## Console Output (Fixed)

### First Death:
```
💀 handleLocalPlayerDeath called
🧹 Force cleaning up any existing death state
💀 Death container created at depth 10000
💀 Auto-respawning after 5 second countdown
🧹 Cancelling emergency respawn timer on respawn ← TIMER CANCELLED
```

### Second Death:
```
💀 handleLocalPlayerDeath called
🧹 Cancelling previous emergency respawn timer ← OLD TIMER CLEARED
🧹 Force cleaning up any existing death state
💀 Death container created at depth 10000
💀 Auto-respawning after 5 second countdown
```

## Testing

1. **Die once** - Death screen appears, respawn after 5s
2. **Die again quickly** - Death screen should stay visible
3. **Watch countdown** - Should count 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 normally
4. **No disappearing** - Screen stays until respawn

The death screen will now work correctly for multiple deaths! 🎮
