# Fog of War System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Player Movement Issue
**Problem**: The green square (local player) was not moving, only the red square (backend position) was moving.

**Solution**: Modified `updateLocalPlayer` in GameScene to include direct local movement calculations:
- Added immediate local movement based on input
- Normalized diagonal movement
- Applied movement speed modifiers (sneak/walk/run)
- Clamped position to game bounds
- Kept client prediction for server synchronization

### 2. Fog Rendering Issue
**Problem**: Fog was only appearing in the top-left corner instead of covering the entire screen.

**Solution**: Simplified the VisionRenderer implementation:
- Removed complex mask system
- Used direct graphics drawing with blend modes
- Fill entire screen with fog first
- Use ERASE blend mode to cut out visible areas
- Properly handle peripheral vision and blind spots

## How It Works Now

1. **Movement**: Player moves immediately based on input, with client prediction handling server reconciliation
2. **Fog**: Dark overlay covers entire screen, with vision areas "erased" to reveal the game world
3. **Vision shapes**: 
   - Main cone: 120° forward arc
   - Peripheral: 30px radius circle
   - Blind spot: 90° cone behind player
   - Extended mouse vision: 30° cone in mouse direction

## Testing
- Press 'V' to toggle vision debug visualization
- Move with WASD to see fog update
- Turn around to see blind spot
- Walls don't block vision yet (backend feature)
