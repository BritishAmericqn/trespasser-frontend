# üîç Frontend Event Debug Report

## Current Status
Frontend is **NOT receiving** the `game:state` event even though backend says they're sending it.

## Debug Logging Added

I've added comprehensive debug logging to track exactly what's happening:

### 1. NetworkSystem.ts
```javascript
// Logs ALL events from backend
üì• BACKEND EVENT: "game:state" - 79 walls, 1 players

// Logs when game state is received
üö® GAME STATE RECEIVED! {
  authenticated: true,
  walls: 79,
  players: 1
}

// Logs when forwarding to GameScene
‚úÖ Forwarding 79 walls to GameScene
```

### 2. GameScene.ts
```javascript
// Logs when GameScene receives the event
üéÆ GameScene received network:gameState! {
  walls: 79,
  players: 1,
  currentWallSprites: 0
}
```

### 3. DestructionRenderer.ts
```javascript
// Logs when walls are being processed
üß± DestructionRenderer received network:gameState {
  hasWalls: true,
  wallCount: 79
}

üì¶ Updating walls from game state: 79 walls
```

## What We Should See

If backend is sending correctly, console should show:

1. `üì• BACKEND EVENT: "game:state" - 79 walls, 1 players`
2. `üö® GAME STATE RECEIVED!`
3. `‚úÖ Forwarding 79 walls to GameScene`
4. `üéÆ GameScene received network:gameState!`
5. `üß± DestructionRenderer received network:gameState`
6. `üì¶ Updating walls from game state: 79 walls`

## What We're Actually Seeing

Based on the screenshot:
- **NONE** of these logs appear
- Test mode auto-activates after 3 seconds
- Wall count stays at 0

## Possible Issues

### 1. Event Name Mismatch
Frontend is listening for: `'game:state'` (with colon)
Backend might be sending: `'gameState'` or `'game_state'`

### 2. Socket Connection Issue
- Socket might not be connected when event is sent
- Socket might be a different instance

### 3. Timing Issue
- Event sent before listeners are set up
- Event sent to wrong socket room

## Test This Now

1. **Reload the page**
2. **Join a game**
3. **Check console for:**
   - Any `üì• BACKEND EVENT:` logs
   - Any `üö® GAME STATE RECEIVED!` logs
   - What events ARE being received

## For Backend Team

Please verify:

1. **Exact event name being sent:**
   ```javascript
   socket.emit('game:state', data);  // MUST be exactly this
   ```

2. **When it's sent:**
   - Should be sent immediately after `player:join` is received
   - Should be sent to the specific socket that joined

3. **Add logging on backend:**
   ```javascript
   socket.on('player:join', (data) => {
     console.log('Received player:join from', socket.id);
     // ... add player ...
     const gameState = getGameState();
     console.log('Sending game:state to', socket.id, 'with', Object.keys(gameState.walls).length, 'walls');
     socket.emit('game:state', gameState);
   });
   ```

## Current Workaround

Frontend auto-activates **TEST MODE** after 3 seconds if no walls are received:
- Creates test map with 120+ walls
- Shows warning: "‚ö†Ô∏è TEST MODE ACTIVATED"
- Press **T** key to manually activate test mode

## Success Criteria

When working correctly:
- No TEST MODE warning
- Walls load immediately
- Console shows all debug logs listed above
