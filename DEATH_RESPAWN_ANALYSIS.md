# 🔍 Death & Respawn System Analysis

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **WASD Movement Removed** ✅
- **Status:** Working as intended
- **Change:** Removed camera movement in spectator mode to prevent disorienting screen movement

### 2. **SPACE/ENTER Not Working** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** `requestRespawn` method was private in GameScene
- **Fix:** Changed to `public requestRespawn()` so InputSystem can call it
- **Note:** Respawn only works after 3-second cooldown (by design)

### 3. **Death Screen Sometimes Missing** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** Possible duplicate death screens or cleanup issues
- **Fix:** Added cleanup check before creating new death screen
- **Added:** Debug logging to track when death screen is created

## How the System Works

### Death Flow:
1. Player dies → `backend:player:killed` event
2. `handleLocalPlayerDeath()` called
3. `isPlayerDead = true` set
4. InputSystem enters spectator mode
5. `showDeathScreen()` creates UI overlay

### Respawn Timing:
- **0-3 seconds:** No manual respawn (cooldown period)
- **3 seconds:** "Press SPACE or ENTER" appears, `canRespawn = true`
- **5 seconds:** Auto-respawn if not manually done
- **Manual respawn:** Press SPACE/ENTER after 3 seconds

### Debug Logs Added:
```javascript
💀 handleLocalPlayerDeath called with: [data]
💀 InputSystem death state set to true
💀 showDeathScreen called with: {killerId, damageType, deathPosition}
💀 Death container created
💀 3 second delay complete, enabling respawn
💀 canRespawn set to true
🎮 SPACE/ENTER key detected in spectator mode
🎮 Respawn key pressed, canRespawn: [true/false]
🎮 Calling requestRespawn on scene
🔄 Requesting respawn from backend
🔄 Sending respawn request to server
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Death Screen Display:**
   - Get killed in game
   - Check console for "showDeathScreen called"
   - Verify death overlay appears with "YOU DIED"

2. **Respawn Cooldown:**
   - Try pressing SPACE immediately after death
   - Should see "Cannot respawn yet - waiting for cooldown"
   - Wait 3 seconds, see "canRespawn set to true"

3. **Manual Respawn:**
   - After 3 seconds, press SPACE or ENTER
   - Should see "Requesting respawn from backend"
   - Death screen should fade away

4. **Auto Respawn:**
   - Don't press anything after death
   - After 5 seconds, should auto-respawn

## Potential Issues to Watch

1. **Team-Specific Issues:**
   - If death screen still doesn't show for red team, check:
   - Player team data in death event
   - Any team-specific rendering layers
   - Z-index/depth conflicts

2. **Backend Response:**
   - Respawn request sent via `this.networkSystem.emit('player:respawn')`
   - Backend must respond with `player:respawned` event
   - Check if backend is handling respawn requests

3. **Multiple Deaths:**
   - Rapid deaths might cause overlay conflicts
   - Cleanup added should prevent this

## Next Steps

1. **Test with both teams** (red and blue)
2. **Monitor console logs** for the debug messages
3. **Verify backend** sends `player:respawned` event
4. **Check if respawn position** is set correctly
