# üîß Scene Render Crash Fix

## Problem Identified

**Game was crashing with "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'drawImage')"**

### What Was Happening:
1. First player joins - works fine
2. Second player joins - freezes immediately  
3. First player moves - also freezes
4. Console error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'drawImage')`

### Root Cause:
- **LobbyStateManager** was continuing to notify scenes after they had been destroyed
- When scenes transitioned (e.g., MatchmakingScene ‚Üí GameScene), the old scene's UI elements were destroyed
- But LobbyStateManager kept trying to update them, causing Phaser rendering crashes

## Solution Implemented

### Added Safety Checks in All State Handlers

#### 1. Check Scene Active Status
```typescript
private handleLobbyStateChange(state: LobbyState | null): void {
  // Safety check: Don't update if scene is not active
  if (!this.scene || !this.scene.isActive()) {
    console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Scene not active, ignoring state change');
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of handler
}
```

#### 2. Check UI Elements Before Update
```typescript
private updatePlayerCount(): void {
  // Safety check: Don't update if scene is not active
  if (!this.scene || !this.scene.isActive()) {
    return;
  }
  
  // Check if UI elements exist and have valid scene reference
  if (this.playerCountText && this.playerCountText.scene) {
    this.playerCountText.setText(`${playerCount}/${maxPlayers}`);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Check Tweens Before Animation
```typescript
// Add pulsing animation only if tweens still exist
if (this.tweens) {
  this.tweens.add({
    targets: this.statusText,
    alpha: 0.7,
    duration: 1000,
    yoyo: true
  });
}
```

## Files Modified

- `src/client/scenes/LobbyWaitingScene.ts`
  - Added `scene.isActive()` checks in `handleLobbyStateChange`
  - Added safety checks in `updatePlayerCount`
  - Added checks for UI element existence before updates

- `src/client/scenes/MatchmakingScene.ts`
  - Added `scene.isActive()` checks in `handleLobbyStateChange`
  - Added safety checks in `updatePlayerCount`
  - Added checks for `statusText.scene` before updates

## What This Fixes

‚úÖ No more "Cannot read properties of null" crashes
‚úÖ Second player can join without freezing
‚úÖ First player can move without freezing
‚úÖ Scenes properly handle state updates after destruction
‚úÖ LobbyStateManager can safely broadcast to all listeners

## Testing

1. Join with first player - should work
2. Join with second player - should NOT freeze
3. Move with either player - should NOT freeze
4. Check console - no rendering errors

## Key Lesson

**Always check if a scene is active and UI elements exist before updating them in Phaser!**

When scenes transition, their UI elements are destroyed but event listeners may still fire. Defensive programming with null checks prevents crashes.
