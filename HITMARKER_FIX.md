# âœ… Hitmarker Fix - Disappearing Issue Resolved

## The Problem
Hitmarkers were appearing on screen but not disappearing, accumulating over time and cluttering the display.

## Root Cause
1. **Slow fade rate**: The original fade rate was only 0.02 alpha per frame (would take ~50 frames to disappear)
2. **No maximum lifetime**: Markers had no guaranteed removal time
3. **Structure issues**: No timestamp tracking for proper age-based removal

## The Fix Applied

### 1. Added Timestamp Tracking
```typescript
// OLD:
private hitMarkers: Phaser.GameObjects.Graphics[] = [];

// NEW:
private hitMarkers: Array<{ graphic: Phaser.GameObjects.Graphics; timestamp: number }> = [];
```

### 2. Implemented Age-Based Fading
```typescript
// Smooth fade based on age (200ms lifetime)
const age = now - marker.timestamp;
const maxAge = 200; // 200ms lifetime
const fadeProgress = age / maxAge;
const alpha = Math.max(0, 1 - fadeProgress);
marker.graphic.setAlpha(alpha);
```

### 3. Guaranteed Removal
```typescript
// Remove if too old OR fully transparent
if (age >= maxAge || marker.graphic.alpha <= 0.01) {
  marker.graphic.destroy();
  this.hitMarkers.splice(i, 1);
}
```

### 4. Visual Improvements
- Increased marker size from 4 to 6 pixels for better visibility
- Added white circle outline for contrast
- Markers now properly fade out over 200ms

## Result
- Hitmarkers now appear for exactly 200ms
- Smooth fade-out animation
- Guaranteed cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Debug logging to track creation/removal

## Testing
1. Fire at enemies or walls
2. You should see red X markers with white circles
3. Markers should fade out smoothly over 200ms
4. Console will log creation and removal for debugging
