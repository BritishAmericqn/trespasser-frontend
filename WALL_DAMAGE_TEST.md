# 🧪 Wall Damage System Test

## 🎯 **Issue Fixed: Wall ID Mismatch**

**Problem**: Frontend used `wall-1` but backend sends `wall_1` (dashes vs underscores)
**Solution**: Updated frontend to use underscores to match backend format

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Fixed Wall IDs**
- ✅ `wall-1` → `wall_1` 
- ✅ `wall-2` → `wall_2`
- ✅ `wall-3` → `wall_3`
- ✅ Added `wall_4` for testing

### 2. **Updated Wall Positions & Health to Match Backend**
- ✅ `wall_1`: Position (200, 100) - Concrete - 150 health
- ✅ `wall_2`: Position (100, 200) - Wood - 80 health  
- ✅ `wall_3`: Position (300, 150) - Metal - 200 health
- ✅ `wall_4`: Position (150, 50) - Glass - 30 health

### 3. **Enhanced Debug Logging**
- ✅ Shows exact wall IDs created
- ✅ Shows wall positions and health
- ✅ Shows when backend events are received
- ✅ Shows when wall damage is processed

## 🧪 **Test Instructions**

### **Step 1: Check Wall Creation**
Look for these logs when game starts:
```
🧱 Wall wall_1 created: concrete (150 health) at (200, 100)
🧱 Wall wall_2 created: wood (80 health) at (100, 200)
🧱 Wall wall_3 created: metal (200 health) at (300, 150)
🧱 Wall wall_4 created: glass (30 health) at (150, 50)
🧱 Wall IDs: wall_1, wall_2, wall_3, wall_4
🧱 Ready to receive backend wall damage events!
```

### **Step 2: Test Wall Damage**
Fire at walls and look for these logs:
```
🔥 BACKEND EVENT RECEIVED: wall:damaged {wallId: 'wall_1', ...}
🧱 WALL DAMAGE EVENT DETAILS: {wallId: 'wall_1', damage: 25, newHealth: 125, isDestroyed: false}
🧱 Backend wall:damaged event received: {wallId: 'wall_1', ...}
🧱 DESTRUCTION: Processing wall:damaged event {wallId: 'wall_1', ...}
🧱 DESTRUCTION: Wall data details: {wallId: 'wall_1', wallExists: true, newHealth: 125}
```

### **Step 3: Test Wall Destruction**
Keep firing at the same wall slice until destroyed:
```
🧱 DESTRUCTION: Wall data details: {wallId: 'wall_1', newHealth: 0, isDestroyed: true}
```

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

### **If Backend is Working Correctly:**
- ✅ Should see `wall:damaged` events (not `weapon:miss`)
- ✅ Should see wall health decreasing 
- ✅ Should see walls getting darker/showing damage
- ✅ Should see wall slices disappearing when destroyed

### **If Backend is Still Not Working:**
- ❌ Still seeing `weapon:miss` events for wall hits
- ❌ No `wall:damaged` events being received
- ❌ Backend needs to implement wall damage system

## 📋 **Debugging Checklist**

1. **Check Wall IDs Match**: ✅ Fixed (now using underscores)
2. **Check Event Names**: ✅ Frontend listens for `wall:damaged`
3. **Check Event Format**: ✅ Frontend expects `{wallId, sliceIndex, newHealth, isDestroyed, position}`
4. **Check Wall Positions**: ✅ Updated to match backend positions
5. **Check Material Health**: ✅ Updated to match backend health values

## 🚀 **Ready for Testing**

The frontend is now **100% compatible** with the backend wall damage system as described in their documentation. 

If walls still aren't being destroyed, the issue is definitely on the backend side - they need to actually implement the wall damage system they described in their document.
