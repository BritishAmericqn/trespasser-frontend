# 🔧 Destroyed Walls Collision Fix

## 🎯 Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Destroyed wall slices were still blocking bullets even after being destroyed.

**Root Cause**: The `destructionMask` wasn't being updated when wall health reached 0.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Wall Damage Handler**
```typescript
// DestructionRenderer.ts - updateWallDamage()
if (newHealth <= 0) {
  wall.destructionMask[sliceIndex] = 1; // Mark as destroyed
  console.log(`💥 Wall ${wallId} slice ${sliceIndex} destroyed (health: 0)`);
}
```

### 2. **Backend isDestroyed Flag**
```typescript
// DestructionRenderer.ts - wall damage event handler
if (data.isDestroyed) {
  wall.destructionMask[data.sliceIndex] = 1;
  console.log('💥 DESTRUCTION: Backend marked slice as destroyed');
}
```

## 🎮 How It Works Now

1. **Client-Side Collision**: The `isPointInWall()` method already checks `destructionMask[sliceIndex] === 0`
2. **When Wall Damaged**: If health reaches 0, slice is marked as destroyed
3. **Bullets Pass Through**: Destroyed slices (destructionMask = 1) no longer block bullets

## 🧪 Test It

1. **Shoot a wall slice multiple times** until it's destroyed
2. **Shoot through the gap** - bullets should pass through
3. **Check console** for "destroyed" messages

## ⚠️ Remaining Issues

### Wall Position Mismatch
The backend might be using center-based positioning while frontend uses top-left:
- **Backend**: Position is wall center
- **Frontend**: Position is top-left corner

This could cause visual misalignment with actual collision boxes.

### Visual Feedback
Destroyed wall slices should:
- Disappear visually
- Show destruction particles
- Leave visible gaps

Currently they just stop rendering but might not show clear visual feedback.

## 📊 Debug Info

When a wall slice is destroyed, you'll see:
```
🧱 Backend wall:damaged event received: {wallId: 'wall_3', newHealth: 0, isDestroyed: true}
💥 Wall wall_3 slice 2 destroyed (health: 0)
💥 DESTRUCTION: Backend marked slice as destroyed
```

Bullets will now pass through destroyed slices!
