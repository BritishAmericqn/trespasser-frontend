### 4. Position Error Debug

## Test Instructions

### Test 1: Single Player Matchmaking
1. Start game â†’ Instant Play â†’ Select loadout
2. Wait for match to start
3. Check console for:
   - "GAME SCENE DEBUG - START"
   - Active scenes list
   - Socket listener counts

### Test 2: Second Player Joins
1. Have player 2 join via Instant Play
2. Watch console for:
   - "New player joined"
   - "SCENE STATE ON PLAYER JOIN"
   - Any "CRITICAL: Game state has NO WALLS" errors
   - "Large position error" warnings

### Test 3: Compare with Private Lobby
1. Use T key to test private lobby
2. Have second player join
3. Compare debug output with matchmaking

## What to Look For

### Red Flags ðŸš©
- Multiple scenes active when game starts
- LobbyStateManager still has state during gameplay
- Game state with no walls when player joins
- Large position errors (>100px)
- Socket listeners > 50

### Expected Issues
1. **Scene Overlap** - Previous scenes not fully stopped
2. **State Manager Interference** - LobbyStateManager updating during game
3. **Full State Reset** - Backend sending complete state instead of delta
4. **Event Duplication** - Multiple handlers for same events

## Next Steps

Based on test results:
1. If scenes overlap â†’ Fix scene cleanup
2. If LobbyStateManager active â†’ Force destroy on game start
3. If state reset â†’ Backend needs to send incremental updates
4. If events duplicate â†’ Remove listeners properly

The key is to make the matchmaking flow as clean as the private lobby flow!
