# Loadout Configuration Fix Summary

## The Problem
The frontend was NOT sending the player's selected loadout to the backend. The backend was always receiving default weapons (rifle, pistol, grenade) regardless of what the player selected.

## Root Causes
1. **Phaser's registry system is scene-specific!**
   - ConfigureScene saved loadout to its scene registry: `this.registry.set('playerLoadout', ...)`
   - NetworkSystem tried to read from ServerConnectionScene's registry: `this.scene.registry.get('playerLoadout')`
   - Since each scene has its own registry, the loadout was never found

2. **Timing issue with player:join event**
   - The event was sent during authentication (before loadout was configured)
   - When already connected, the event was never sent at all

## The Fix
1. **Changed all registry access to use the game registry** instead of scene registry:
   - Save: `this.game.registry.set('playerLoadout', this.loadout)`
   - Read: `this.scene.game.registry.get('playerLoadout')`

2. **Moved player:join event to GameScene start**:
   - Removed from NetworkSystem's onGameReady (too early)
   - Added to GameScene.create() when scene starts
   - Added 1-second failsafe resend for reliability

## Testing Instructions

1. **Configure your loadout**:
   - Go to Configure Loadout
   - Select: Shotgun + Suppressed Pistol + Machine Gun
   - Select Red team
   - Click "JOIN GAME"

2. **In browser console, you should see**:
   ```
   ðŸŽ® GameScene: Sending player:join with loadout
   ðŸ“¤ Sending to backend: player:join {loadout: {...}}
   ðŸŽ® GameScene: Sending player:join again (failsafe)
   ```

3. **Check the backend received**:
   - Primary: shotgun (not rifle)
   - Secondary: suppressedpistol (not pistol)
   - Support: ['machinegun'] (not ['grenade'])
   - Team: red (not blue)

4. **Debug keys in game**:
   - Press **L** - Check current loadout
   - Press **J** - Manually send player:join (for testing)
   - Press **N** - Check network status

## Why It Works Now
- Loadout is saved to game-wide registry (accessible from any scene)
- Player:join is sent when GameScene starts (after loadout is configured)
- Failsafe ensures the event is sent even if there are timing issues
- Manual J key allows testing without reconnecting
