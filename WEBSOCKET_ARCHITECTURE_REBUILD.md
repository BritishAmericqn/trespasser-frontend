# üèóÔ∏è WebSocket Architecture Rebuild Plan

## Current Issues
1. Events are received but not properly processed
2. Too many band-aid fixes and forced actions
3. Authentication checks blocking game state
4. Scene detection failing
5. Events not reaching rendering systems

## Proper Event Flow Architecture

### 1. Backend ‚Üí Frontend Events

**Lobby Events:**
- `lobby_joined` - Player joins a lobby
- `player_joined_lobby` - Another player joins
- `player_left_lobby` - Player leaves
- `match_starting` - Countdown begins
- `match_started` - Game begins

**Game Events:**
- `game:state` - Full game state (walls, players, vision)
- `player:joined` - Player joined game
- `player:left` - Player left game
- `player:died` - Player death
- `wall:damaged` - Wall damage update
- `wall:destroyed` - Wall destroyed

### 2. Frontend ‚Üí Backend Events

**Lobby Events:**
- `find_match` - Join matchmaking
- `create_private_lobby` - Create private game
- `join_lobby` - Join specific lobby
- `leave_lobby` - Leave current lobby

**Game Events:**
- `player:join` - Join game with loadout
- `player:input` - Send input state
- `weapon:fire` - Fire weapon
- `weapon:reload` - Reload weapon
- `request_game_state` - Request full state

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth
- NetworkSystem is the ONLY component that talks to the backend
- All other systems communicate through events

### 2. Clear Separation of Concerns
- **NetworkSystem**: WebSocket communication only
- **GameScene**: Game logic and coordination
- **DestructionRenderer**: Wall rendering
- **VisionRenderer**: Visibility system
- **PlayerManager**: Player state management

### 3. Event Processing Pipeline

```
Backend Event
    ‚Üì
NetworkSystem (receives)
    ‚Üì
NetworkSystem (validates)
    ‚Üì
NetworkSystem (forwards to active scene)
    ‚Üì
GameScene (processes)
    ‚Üì
Specific Systems (render/update)
```

### 4. No Forced Actions
- Remove all `if (true)` hacks
- Remove all forced test modes
- Remove all emergency transitions
- Proper error handling instead of fallbacks

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Clean NetworkSystem
Remove all hacks and implement proper event handling:
- Remove authentication blocking
- Remove scene detection hacks
- Implement proper event forwarding
- Add comprehensive error handling

### Step 2: Fix GameScene Event Processing
Ensure GameScene properly receives and processes events:
- Listen for `network:gameState`
- Process walls, players, vision
- Update all subsystems

### Step 3: Fix Rendering Pipeline
Ensure rendering systems receive data:
- DestructionRenderer gets walls
- VisionRenderer gets visibility
- PlayerManager gets players

### Step 4: Remove Test Mode Hacks
- Remove auto-activation
- Remove forced test mode
- Keep manual test mode for development only

## Expected Event Flow

### On Game Join:
1. Frontend sends `player:join` with loadout
2. Backend sends `game:state` with full state
3. NetworkSystem receives and forwards to GameScene
4. GameScene updates all subsystems
5. Walls render, vision updates, player spawns

### During Game:
1. Backend sends periodic `game:state` updates
2. NetworkSystem forwards to GameScene
3. GameScene updates changed elements
4. Smooth interpolation between states

## Success Metrics
- Walls render immediately on join
- No test mode activation needed
- No console errors or warnings
- Smooth multiplayer experience
- Clean, maintainable code
