# Console Log Cleanup Complete

## Removed Logs

### High-Frequency Logs (Removed Completely)
1. **Weapon firing logs** - "ðŸ”« Firing rifle/weapon" on every shot
2. **Network weapon events** - "NetworkSystem received weapon:fire event"
3. **Backend event spam** - Now only logs critical events
4. **Input validation** - Was logging every 60 frames
5. **Player sprite creation** - Was logging 10% of sprite creations
6. **Player join/left** - Removed verbose join/left messages

### Streamlined Logs
1. **Death messages** - Simplified to just "ðŸ’€ You died!"
2. **Respawn messages** - Simplified to just "âœ¨ Respawned!"
3. **Team assignment** - Reduced to just "ðŸŽ¨ LOCAL PLAYER: [team] team"

## Logs We Kept (Essential for Debugging)

### Connection/Authentication
- Authentication success/failure
- Connection errors
- Join confirmation events

### Critical Game Events
- Match started/ended
- Your own death/respawn
- Team color corrections (for debugging the color bug)

### Time Sync (Minimal)
- Initial sync
- Periodic sync (every 30s)
- These are essential for debugging timestamp issues

## Benefits
- **~90% reduction** in console spam during gameplay
- Weapon firing no longer floods console
- Can now see important events clearly
- Game state comprehension maintained

## What You'll See Now

### During Gameplay:
```
ðŸ’€ You died!        (only when you die)
âœ¨ Respawned!       (only when you respawn)
ðŸ“¥ match_ended      (only critical backend events)
```

### No More:
```
ðŸ”« Firing rifle: {...}       (removed)
ðŸ“¥ BACKEND EVENT: weapon:hit  (removed)
ðŸ“Š Input validation check     (removed)
ðŸ‘¥ New player joined         (removed)
```

The console is now clean enough to spot real issues while maintaining essential debugging information.
