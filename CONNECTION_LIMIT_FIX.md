# üîß Connection Attempt Limit Fix

## The Problem
You were hitting "Too many connection attempts" errors because:
1. Socket.IO was retrying connections too aggressively (every 1 second)
2. MenuScene auto-connects on every load
3. Multiple concurrent connection attempts were possible
4. During development, frequent refreshes would trigger rapid reconnection attempts

## The Fix Applied

### 1. Reduced Aggressive Reconnection
```javascript
// OLD:
reconnectionDelay: 1000,        // 1 second
reconnectionDelayMax: 5000,     // 5 seconds max
reconnectionAttempts: 5          // 5 attempts

// NEW:
reconnectionDelay: 2000,        // 2 seconds (doubled)
reconnectionDelayMax: 10000,    // 10 seconds max (doubled)
reconnectionAttempts: 3          // 3 attempts (reduced)
```

### 2. Prevented Concurrent Connection Attempts
Added a `connectionInProgress` flag to prevent multiple simultaneous connection attempts:
```javascript
if (this.connectionInProgress) {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Connection already in progress, ignoring duplicate request');
  return;
}
```

### 3. Improved MenuScene Auto-Connect
Enhanced the check to avoid reconnecting if already connected:
```javascript
// Now checks both connected AND authenticated states
if (networkSystem.isSocketConnected()) {
  if (networkSystem.isAuthenticated()) {
    console.log('‚úÖ Already connected and authenticated');
  } else {
    console.log('‚úÖ Already connected, waiting for authentication');
  }
  return;
}
```

## Result
- **Slower retry pace**: 2-second initial delay instead of 1 second
- **Fewer attempts**: Only 3 attempts instead of 5
- **Longer backoff**: Up to 10 seconds between retries
- **No duplicate attempts**: Connection requests are ignored if one is already in progress
- **Smart auto-connect**: Won't attempt to reconnect if already connected

## Why This Happened
During development, rapid page refreshes and scene transitions were causing:
1. Multiple MenuScene instances trying to auto-connect
2. Socket.IO aggressive retry logic hitting backend rate limits
3. Concurrent connection attempts from different parts of the code

## Testing
1. Refresh the page multiple times quickly
2. You should no longer see "Too many connection attempts" errors
3. Connection will retry more slowly and gracefully
