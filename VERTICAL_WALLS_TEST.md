# Vertical Walls Frontend Implementation Test Guide

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

The frontend has been updated to properly handle vertical walls and filter boundary walls.

### Changes Made:

1. **DestructionRenderer.ts**:
   - Added `orientation` field to Wall interface
   - Updated `renderWall` method to render slices based on orientation
   - Updated wall creation to set orientation from backend or calculate it

2. **GameScene.ts**: 
   - Updated `updateWallsFromDestructionRenderer` to respect wall orientation
   - Added boundary wall filtering (walls outside 0,0 to 480,270 are not rendered)

3. **Test Walls**:
   - Added vertical test walls (wall_2, wall_4, wall_5 are now vertical)

### Testing Instructions:

1. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Vertical Wall Destruction** (Press 'B' key):
   - Should damage a random wall slice
   - For vertical walls: horizontal strips should be destroyed
   - For horizontal walls: vertical strips should be destroyed

3. **Visual Verification**:
   - **Horizontal walls** (wall_1, wall_3): Wider than tall, slices are vertical
   - **Vertical walls** (wall_2, wall_4, wall_5): Taller than wide, slices are horizontal

4. **Boundary Wall Filtering**:
   - No walls should be visible outside the 480x270 game area
   - All boundary walls from backend should be invisible

### Expected Behavior:

#### Horizontal Wall (e.g., wall_1):
```
+----+----+----+----+----+
|  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  ‚Üê Slice numbers
+----+----+----+----+----+
```
When slice 3 is destroyed, a vertical gap appears.

#### Vertical Wall (e.g., wall_2):  
```
+----+ 
|  1 |
+----+
|  2 |
+----+
|  3 | ‚Üê Slice numbers
+----+
|  4 |
+----+
|  5 |
+----+
```
When slice 3 is destroyed, a horizontal gap appears.

### Debug Commands:
- Press **'D'**: Show wall debug info
- Press **'B'**: Simulate random wall damage
- Press **'C'**: Check connection status

## üéØ Ready for Backend Integration!

The frontend is now ready to receive wall data with the `orientation` field from the backend. All rendering issues should be resolved.
