# Hit Detection Console Logs - Streamlined

## What's Being Logged

### 1. **Weapon Firing** (InputSystem)
```
🔫 FIRING rifle from (240,135) → (350,200) angle: 45°
```
Shows:
- Weapon type
- Starting position (where shot from)
- Target position (where aiming)
- Angle in degrees

### 2. **Backend Events** (NetworkSystem)
```
🔵 BACKEND EVENT: weapon:fired {data}
🔵 BACKEND EVENT: weapon:hit {data}
🔵 BACKEND EVENT: wall:damaged {data}
```
Only logs weapon/hit/damage related events from backend

### 3. **Hit Detection Results** (VisualEffectsSystem)

#### Shot Fired (from backend):
```
🔫 SHOT: rifle from (240,135) → hit at (320,180)
```

#### Player Hit:
```
🎯 HIT: Player at (320,180)
```

#### Wall Hit:
```
❌ MISS: Wall hit at (320,180)
🧱 WALL DAMAGED: wall_1 at (320,180)
```

#### Client-side Wall Detection:
```
🔫 rifle HIT WALL at (320,180) - distance: 95px
💥 grenade HIT WALL (explosion) at (320,180)
```

### 4. **Wall Damage** (DestructionRenderer)
```
🧱 WALL DAMAGE: wall_1 slice 2 - health: 75
🧱 WALL DAMAGE: wall_1 slice 2 - health: 0 (DESTROYED)
```

## What's NOT Being Logged Anymore

- Connection status messages
- Game state updates
- Player position syncs
- Movement updates
- Input state tracking
- System initialization messages
- Verbose event details
- Test effect triggers
- General debug info

## Usage

This streamlined logging focuses only on:
1. **Where** bullets are shot from
2. **What** they hit (player/wall)
3. **Where** they hit
4. **Damage** dealt to walls

Perfect for debugging hit detection issues without console spam!

# Hit Detection Console Logs - CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND

## The Problem in the Logs

### What SHOULD Happen:
```
🔫 FIRING rifle from (283.33, 152.5) → (325, 158) angle: 8°
🎯 CLIENT HIT DETECTION: Wall wall_4 hit at (208.9, 59.1)
🔥 BACKEND EVENT RECEIVED: wall:damaged {...}  ← THIS NEVER HAPPENS!
```

### What ACTUALLY Happens:
```
🔫 FIRING rifle from (283.33, 152.5) → (325, 158) angle: 8°
🎯 CLIENT HIT DETECTION: Wall wall_4 hit at (208.9, 59.1)
🔥 BACKEND EVENT RECEIVED: weapon:miss  ← ALWAYS THIS!
```

## Key Log Messages to Watch

### 1. **Frontend Firing Log** (✅ Working)
```
🔫 FIRING rifle from (X,Y) → (targetX,targetY) angle: N°
```
This shows what the frontend sends to backend.

### 2. **Client Hit Detection** (✅ Working)
```
🎯 CLIENT HIT DETECTION: Wall wall_N hit at (X, Y)
   Wall bounds: x:MIN-MAX, y:MIN-MAX
```
This shows the frontend correctly detects wall collisions.

### 3. **Backend Response** (❌ BROKEN)
```
🔥 BACKEND EVENT RECEIVED: weapon:miss
```
This shows the backend ALWAYS returns miss for wall hits.

### 4. **Missing Events** (❌ NEVER SEEN)
```
🔥 BACKEND EVENT RECEIVED: wall:damaged  ← NEVER HAPPENS
🔥 BACKEND EVENT RECEIVED: wall:destroyed ← NEVER HAPPENS
```

## Debug Process

1. **Fire at a wall**
2. **Look for these 3 lines in sequence**:
   ```
   🔫 FIRING...
   🎯 CLIENT HIT DETECTION...
   🔥 BACKEND EVENT RECEIVED...
   ```
3. **If backend says `weapon:miss` after client detected hit** = Backend bug confirmed

## Visual Indicators

Even though backend doesn't recognize hits:
- ✅ Bullet trails stop at walls (client-side)
- ✅ Impact effects show (client-side)
- ✅ Wall damage particles appear (client-side)
- ❌ Wall health doesn't decrease (needs backend)
- ❌ Walls can't be destroyed (needs backend)

## Summary

**EVERY wall hit is being treated as a miss by the backend.**

The frontend is working perfectly - it's the backend that needs to implement wall collision detection.
