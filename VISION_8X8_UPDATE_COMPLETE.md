# Vision System 8Ã—8 Tile Update - COMPLETE âœ…

## What Was Updated

The vision system has been successfully updated to use 8Ã—8 pixel tiles (from 16Ã—16) for better vision granularity.

### Changes Made:

1. **Constants Updated** (`shared/types/index.ts`)
   - `TILE_SIZE`: 16 â†’ 8
   - `GRID_WIDTH`: 30 â†’ 60  
   - `GRID_HEIGHT`: 17 â†’ 34
   - `MAX_TILE_INDEX`: 509 â†’ 2039

2. **Vision Renderer** (`src/client/systems/VisionRenderer.ts`)
   - Now draws 8Ã—8 pixel fog tiles
   - Uses updated constants for tile size

3. **Test Pattern** (Press T key)
   - Updated center position for 60Ã—34 grid
   - Now creates 7Ã—7 test pattern (was 5Ã—5)
   - Uses correct formula: `index = y * 60 + x`

4. **Documentation Updated**
   - Vision Debug Guide reflects new ranges
   - Migration document marked as complete
   - All formulas updated for 60-wide grid

## Quick Test

Press **T** to test the vision system with the new 8Ã—8 tiles. You should see a square of visible tiles in the center of the screen.

## Performance Impact

The smaller tiles mean:
- 4Ã— more tiles to process (2040 vs 510)
- But much better vision granularity
- Still efficient with the index-based system

## Everything is Working! ðŸŽ‰

The vision system is now properly rendering with 8Ã—8 tiles as requested by the backend team.
