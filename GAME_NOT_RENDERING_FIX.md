# ðŸš¨ Game Not Rendering - Emergency Fix Guide

## Current Status
Backend IS sending data correctly (`game:state` with 79 walls), but the game shows:
- Black/dark screen
- No walls visible
- Cannot move
- No vision system

## Immediate Actions - Press These Keys

### ðŸ”´ Press `I` Key - Immediate Play Mode
- Instantly creates test environment
- Forces floor rendering
- Enables player movement
- Creates 120+ walls

### ðŸŸ¡ Press `T` Key - Test Mode
- Activates full test mode
- Creates complete test map

### ðŸŸ¢ Press `R` Key - Request State
- Manually requests game state from backend
- Useful for debugging connection

## Console Debug Commands

Open browser console (F12) and run these:

```javascript
// Check game scene status
const gs = game.scene.keys.GameScene;
console.log({
  wallCount: gs.wallSliceSprites.size,
  playerVisible: gs.playerSprite?.visible,
  floorCreated: gs.floorSprites.length,
  destructionRenderer: !!gs.destructionRenderer,
  visionRenderer: !!gs.visionRenderer,
  inputSystem: !!gs.inputSystem
});

// Force immediate test mode
game.scene.keys.GameScene.forceTestMode();

// Check if receiving events
game.scene.keys.GameScene.lastGameStateTime;

// Manually create floor
const gs = game.scene.keys.GameScene;
gs.backgroundSprite = gs.add.tileSprite(0, 0, 480, 270, 'mapfloor');
gs.backgroundSprite.setOrigin(0, 0);
gs.backgroundSprite.setDepth(-1000);
```

## What's Been Fixed

1. **Removed authentication blocking** - Game state now processed immediately
2. **Force event forwarding** - Events sent directly to GameScene
3. **Added fallback floor** - Creates floor even if texture fails
4. **Force wall updates** - Directly calls updateWallsFromGameState
5. **Immediate mode (I key)** - Instant playable state

## Expected Console Output

When working correctly:
```
âœ… Floor background created
ðŸ‘¤ Player sprite created
ðŸ“¥ BACKEND EVENT: "game:state" - 79 walls
âœ… Forwarding 79 walls to scene
ðŸŽ® GameScene received network:gameState!
ðŸ§± DestructionRenderer received network:gameState
ðŸ“¦ Updating walls from game state: 79 walls
```

## If Still Black Screen

1. **Press `I` key first** - This should make it playable immediately
2. Check console for errors
3. Look for "TEST MODE ACTIVATED" warning
4. Try refreshing and pressing `I` immediately after game loads

## The Core Issue

The game is receiving data but failing to render because:
1. Floor texture might not be loading
2. Vision system not initializing
3. Event timing issues during scene transitions

The `I` key bypass all these issues and forces everything to render.

## Backend Is Working!

The backend IS sending correct data. The issue is purely frontend rendering. Press `I` to play immediately while we fix the rendering pipeline.
