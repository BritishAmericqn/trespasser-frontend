# ✅ Respawn and Team Color Fixes Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Respawn Keys Not Working** ✅
**Problem:** SPACE/ENTER keys were being checked every frame, causing throttling issues
**Root Cause:** `isDown` checks on every frame instead of detecting key press transitions
**Fix:** 
- Added `respawnKeyWasPressed` flag to track previous state
- Only trigger respawn on key press (not hold)
- Detects transition from not pressed → pressed

**Code Changed:**
```typescript
// Before: Checked every frame
if (this.keys.space?.isDown || this.keys.enter?.isDown) {
  // This ran every frame while key was held
}

// After: Only on key press
const respawnKeyIsDown = this.keys.space?.isDown || this.keys.enter?.isDown;
if (respawnKeyIsDown && !this.respawnKeyWasPressed) {
  // Only runs once per key press
}
this.respawnKeyWasPressed = respawnKeyIsDown;
```

### 2. **Red Team Wrong Color/Position** ✅
**Problem:** Red team players spawned with blue color and wrong position until tab-in
**Root Cause:** Initial player sprite created before receiving backend game state
**Fix:**
- Added synchronization with backend on first game state reception
- Checks player data from backend and updates sprite texture if mismatch
- Updates position to match backend's authoritative position

**Code Changed:**
```typescript
// Now checks on first game state:
if (isFirstGameState) {
  // Find player in game state
  if (myPlayerData.team) {
    const currentTexture = this.playerSprite.texture.key;
    const expectedTexture = myPlayerData.team === 'red' ? 'player_red' : 'player_blue';
    
    if (currentTexture !== expectedTexture) {
      // Update sprite to correct team color
      this.playerSprite.setTexture(expectedTexture);
      this.playerLoadout.team = myPlayerData.team;
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Death & Respawn Flow:
1. Player dies → Death screen appears
2. Wait 3 seconds → "Press SPACE or ENTER" appears
3. Press SPACE/ENTER once → Respawn request sent
4. Backend responds → Player respawns

### Team Synchronization:
1. Player joins with selected team
2. Backend assigns final team (may override for balance)
3. First game state received → Sprite updated to match backend team
4. Position synced from backend → Player at correct spawn point

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Respawn:**
   - Get killed
   - Wait 3 seconds for prompt
   - Press SPACE or ENTER once (don't hold)
   - Should respawn without throttling

2. **Test Red Team:**
   - Select red team in configure screen
   - Join game
   - Should spawn with red sprite at red spawn point
   - No more blue sprite that changes on tab

## Console Logs to Monitor

**Respawn:**
```
🎮 Respawn key PRESSED (new press detected)
🎮 canRespawn: true
🎮 Calling requestRespawn on scene
🔄 Requesting respawn from backend
```

**Team Sync:**
```
📍 Found player data in game state: {team: "red", position: {...}}
🎨 Updating player sprite from player_blue to player_red (team: red)
✅ Player position synced from game state: {x: 420, y: 50}
```
