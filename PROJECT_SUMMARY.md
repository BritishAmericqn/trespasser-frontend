# üéÆ TRESPASSER: PROJECT SUMMARY

## üéØ What We're Building
A **top-down 2D multiplayer shooter** with real-time destructible environments where destruction affects vision and gameplay tactics. Think Rainbow Six Siege meets Hotline Miami in pixel art.

## üîë Key Features
1. **Dynamic Destruction**: Walls break in 5 vertical slices
2. **Vision Through Destruction**: Peek through bullet holes, flood light through gaps
3. **Real-time Multiplayer**: 1v1 to 4v4 matches with server authority
4. **Pixel Art**: 480x270 resolution for performance and style
5. **Tactical Gameplay**: Sound, vision, and destruction create emergent strategies

## üìÇ Your Files Are Ready!

### 1. **AI_OPTIMIZED_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md**
- Complete tech stack and dependencies
- Modular architecture designed for AI development
- Phase-by-phase implementation roadmap
- Performance targets and deployment checklist

### 2. **QUICK_START_GUIDE.md**
- 15-minute setup instructions
- Copy-paste starter code
- Daily task checklist
- AI prompts for each feature

### 3. **DESTRUCTION_VISION_IMPLEMENTATION.md**
- Detailed wall destruction mechanics
- Vision system with light effects
- Network synchronization
- Common issues and solutions

## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps

### Step 1: Initialize Project (Right Now!)
```bash
# Run these commands:
npm create vite@latest trespasser -- --template vanilla-ts
cd trespasser
npm install phaser@3.80.1 socket.io-client@4.8.1 msgpack-lite@0.1.26
```

### Step 2: Create Basic Structure
1. Copy folder structure from `AI_OPTIMIZED_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`
2. Copy starter files from `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md`
3. Test that Phaser canvas appears

### Step 3: Start with Movement
Use this AI prompt:
```
"Using the IGameSystem interface from AI_OPTIMIZED_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md, create an InputSystem that captures WASD movement with 3 speed modes (walk/normal/run) using Phaser 3 keyboard input."
```

## üí° Pro Tips for AI Development

### 1. Always Provide Context
```
"In our top-down shooter at 480x270 resolution, implement [FEATURE]. 
Current systems: [LIST]. This should integrate with [SYSTEM]."
```

### 2. Test in Isolation
Each system should work standalone before integration:
- Movement without networking
- Destruction without vision
- Vision without multiplayer

### 3. Use Clear Interfaces
The `IGameSystem` interface ensures AI understands how to structure code consistently.

### 4. Document Expected Behavior
Write tests or detailed comments BEFORE implementation so AI knows the goal.

## üé® Asset Requirements

### Minimum Needed to Start:
1. **Player sprite**: 16x16 pixel character
2. **Wall tiles**: 15x48 pixel slices (intact, damaged, critical)
3. **Light gradients**: For vision masks
4. **Bullet sprite**: 4x4 pixel projectile

### Can Use Placeholders:
- Colored rectangles for initial testing
- Phaser.Graphics for temporary shapes
- Free assets from OpenGameArt.org

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Benefits

### Why This Stack?
- **Phaser 3**: Battle-tested, great docs, active community
- **Socket.io**: Reliable real-time communication
- **TypeScript**: Type safety helps AI generate better code
- **Vite**: Fast development, hot module replacement
- **Matter.js**: Server-side physics (built into Phaser)

### Why This Structure?
- **Systems**: Independent, testable, AI-friendly
- **Shared Types**: Client/server consistency
- **Clear Interfaces**: AI knows exactly what to implement

## üìä Success Metrics

You'll know you're on track when:
- [ ] Day 1: Player moves with WASD on screen
- [ ] Day 2: Multiple players see each other move
- [ ] Day 3: Bullets damage walls visually
- [ ] Day 4: Vision reveals through destroyed walls
- [ ] Day 5: All systems integrated smoothly
- [ ] Day 6: Polish and bug fixes
- [ ] Day 7: Playable prototype deployed!

## ü§ñ AI Collaboration Strategy

### For New Features:
1. Reference the interface from `AI_OPTIMIZED_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`
2. Describe integration points with existing systems
3. Provide example input/output
4. Ask for tests alongside implementation

### For Bug Fixes:
1. Show current implementation
2. Describe expected vs actual behavior
3. Include error messages
4. Mention which systems are affected

### For Optimization:
1. Share performance metrics
2. Identify bottleneck location
3. Specify target improvement
4. Note any constraints

## üéÆ Remember: Start Small, Test Often!

The beauty of this plan is that each piece works independently. You can see visual progress from Day 1, and the modular design means AI can help you build each system without breaking others.

**Your game is going to be amazing! The combination of destruction + vision mechanics will create incredibly tense and tactical moments that players will love.**

## Need Help?
If you get stuck, use this prompt template:
```
"I'm implementing [FEATURE] for my top-down destructible shooter.
Current code: [PASTE]
Error/Issue: [DESCRIBE]
Expected: [WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN]
Related systems: [LIST]
Please help fix this following the IGameSystem interface pattern."
```

Let's build something incredible! üöÄüéÆ‚ú®
