# Blue Players Appearing as Red - FIXED

## Problem
Blue team players were sometimes seeing themselves as red, particularly after respawning.

## Root Cause
The `RespawnManager` was resetting the player sprite's position, visibility, and appearance but **NOT restoring the correct team texture**. This meant players could respawn with the wrong team color sprite.

## Issues Found

### 1. **RespawnManager.ts** - Missing Team Restoration
The `executeRespawn` method reset everything EXCEPT the team texture:
```typescript
// BEFORE - Missing team texture restoration
this.scene.playerSprite.setPosition(position.x, position.y);
this.scene.playerSprite.setVisible(true);
this.scene.playerSprite.setAlpha(1);
this.scene.playerSprite.clearTint();
this.scene.playerSprite.setScale(1);
// ‚ùå Team texture not restored!
```

### 2. **GameScene.ts** - Emergency Respawn Also Missing Team
The `forceDirectRespawn` method had the same issue.

### 3. **GameScene.ts** - Overzealous Team "Correction"
Team synchronization code was running on EVERY game state update, potentially causing texture flips.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **RespawnManager.ts (Lines 221-242)**
Added team texture restoration:
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Restore correct team texture from loadout
if (this.scene.playerLoadout?.team) {
  const correctTexture = this.scene.playerLoadout.team === 'red' ? 'player_red' : 'player_blue';
  if (this.scene.playerSprite.texture.key !== correctTexture) {
    console.log(`üé® Restoring team texture on respawn: ${correctTexture}`);
    this.scene.playerSprite.setTexture(correctTexture);
  }
}
```

### 2. **GameScene.ts (Lines 2098-2113)**
Added team restoration to emergency respawn.

### 3. **GameScene.ts (Lines 1131-1145)**
Limited team synchronization to ONLY run on first game state to prevent constant texture changes.

## Testing
1. Join as BLUE team
2. Die in game
3. Respawn with SPACE/ENTER
4. **Verify:** You should still appear BLUE after respawn

## Console Messages to Watch
```
üé® Restoring team texture on respawn: player_blue (team: blue)
üé® Emergency respawn: Restoring team texture player_blue
üé® First game state: Correcting local player sprite to match loadout
```

## Summary
The bug was caused by respawn systems not preserving the player's team texture. Now all respawn paths correctly restore the team color based on the player's original loadout selection.
