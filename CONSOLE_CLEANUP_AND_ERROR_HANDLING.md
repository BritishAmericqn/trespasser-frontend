# üßπ Console Cleanup & Error Handling

## Changes Made to Reduce Console Spam

### 1. **NetworkSystem.ts**
- **Game State Logging:** Reduced from every frame to 1% sampling
  ```typescript
  // Before: Logged every game:state event (20Hz = 20 logs/second)
  // After: Only 1% chance to log (0.2 logs/second average)
  ```
- **Backend Event Logging:** Skip high-frequency events
  ```typescript
  // Now skips: 'game:state' and 'player:updated' events
  // Still logs: Important events like player joins/leaves
  ```

### 2. **PlayerManager.ts**
- **Player Count Logging:** Reduced from every frame to 0.5% sampling
  ```typescript
  // Before: "Updating X other players" every frame
  // After: Only samples occasionally
  ```

### 3. **GameScene.ts**
- **Warning Messages:** Only log once instead of every frame
  ```typescript
  // Added flags to prevent spam:
  - updateWarned
  - updateLocalPlayerWarned
  - movementLogged
  ```

### 4. **Added Error Handling**
- Wrapped critical operations in try-catch blocks:
  - `clientPrediction.applyInput()`
  - `clientPrediction.updateRenderPosition()`
  - `playerSprite.setRotation()`
  - `playerSprite.setPosition()`

## What to Look For Now

With reduced console spam, you should be able to see:

1. **Movement Detection:**
   - Look for: `üéÆ Movement detected:` when you first press a movement key
   
2. **Error Messages:**
   - `‚ùå Error applying input to client prediction:`
   - `‚ùå Error updating render position:`
   - `‚ùå Error updating player sprite rotation:`
   - `‚ùå Error setting player sprite position:`

3. **Important Events Only:**
   - Player joins/leaves
   - Match state changes
   - Actual errors

## Debugging the Freeze

Now when the visual freezes after movement, check for:
1. Any error messages in the console
2. Whether movement is being detected
3. If game state updates continue (you'll see occasional samples)
4. Any specific error when the freeze occurs

The console should now be much cleaner, making it easier to identify the actual cause of the freeze.
