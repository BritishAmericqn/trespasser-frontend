# ✅ Death Screen Fixed & Restored

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Removed Aggressive Fallbacks**
- Removed 1-second force enable (was too quick)
- Removed 8-second auto-respawn (was interfering)
- Kept only 10-second emergency fallback

### 2. **Enhanced Death Screen Visibility**
- Increased depth to 10000 (was 1000)
- Added `setScrollFactor(0)` to keep it in place
- Made background darker (0.8 opacity)
- Made "YOU DIED" text bigger (36px) and bold
- Added text shadow for better visibility
- Removed fade-in (shows immediately)

### 3. **Fixed Auto-Respawn Countdown**
- Shows "Auto-respawn in 5s" immediately
- Counts down properly: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
- Auto-respawns after 5 seconds
- Shows "Respawning..." at 0

---

## Death Flow Now Works Like This

### When You Die:
1. **Immediately**: Big red "YOU DIED" appears
2. **Immediately**: Shows "Auto-respawn in 5s" countdown
3. **After 3 seconds**: Shows "Press SPACE or ENTER to respawn"
4. **After 5 seconds**: Auto-respawns if not manually done

### Manual Respawn:
- After 3 seconds, press SPACE or ENTER
- Immediate respawn request to backend

### Emergency Fallbacks:
- **R key**: Force respawn if stuck
- **10 seconds**: Emergency recovery if all else fails

## Testing

1. **Get killed** - Should see "YOU DIED" immediately
2. **Watch countdown** - Should count 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
3. **Manual respawn** - After 3s, press SPACE
4. **Auto-respawn** - Wait 5s, should respawn automatically

## If Still Not Visible

Check console for:
- "Failed to create death screen" - Error in creation
- "Death container created" - Confirms it was made
- "Death screen set to visible" - Confirms alpha = 1

If death screen created but not visible:
- Check if other UI elements have higher depth
- Check if camera is positioned strangely
- Try pressing F5 to refresh and test again
