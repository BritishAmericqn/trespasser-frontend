# Feature Implementation Roadmap - UPDATED FOR 1v1-4v4
# Full Original Vision is Achievable!

## Overview
**MAJOR UPDATE**: With 1v1-4v4 gameplay and 480x270 pixel art, we can implement ALL original features with room to spare. This roadmap reflects an aggressive but achievable timeline.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation Systems (Day 1 Morning)
**Quick setup since everything is simpler**

#### Core Architecture
- **Event Bus System**: For inter-system communication
- **Basic Phaser Setup**: 480x270 render target
- **Resource Manager**: Asset loading
- **Socket.io**: Basic connection
- **Game Loop**: Fixed timestep

#### Map Foundation
- **Pixel-Based Map**: Simple grid at 480x270
- **Basic Rendering**: Pixel-perfect scaling
- **Coordinate System**: Already decided

**Time**: 4 hours (everything is simpler at this scale)

---

### Phase 1: Movement & Core (Day 1 Afternoon - Day 2 Morning)

#### 1.1 Full Movement System
**All three speeds from the start**:
- Input handler with Ctrl/Shift modifiers
- Position/velocity components
- Pixel-perfect collision

**Features**:
- **Sneak (Ctrl)**: 50% speed, quiet
- **Walk**: Normal speed
- **Run (Shift)**: 150% speed, forward-only, loud

#### 1.2 Camera & Vision Basics
**Full vision system early**:
- Viewport at 480x270
- Mouse tracking for extended vision
- Basic fog of war rendering
- Scanline vision algorithm

**Time**: 8 hours (movement + vision basics)

---

### Phase 2: Networking (Day 2 Afternoon)

#### 2.1 Full Multiplayer
**8 players is easy to handle**:
- Server authoritative
- State sync at 20Hz
- Player session management
- Optimized protocol

#### 2.2 Complete Movement Sync
**All features networked**:
- Client prediction
- Server reconciliation
- Interpolation (simple at pixel scale)
- All three movement speeds

**Time**: 6 hours (much simpler with 8 players)

---

### Phase 3: Weapons & Destruction (Day 3)

#### 3.1 Complete Weapon System
**Build all weapons at once**:
- Full weapon stats system
- Hitscan bullets
- Physics projectiles (grenades/rockets)
- ADS system
- All visual feedback

#### 3.2 Full Destruction System
**5 vertical slices from day one**:
- Bit-mask wall storage
- Progressive damage states
- Material system (SOFT/HARD)
- Network sync with delta compression
- Visual degradation

**Time**: Full day (but everything works)

---

### Phase 4: Advanced Vision & Sound (Day 4)

#### 4.1 Complete Vision System
**All features implemented**:
- Vision through holes (narrow FOV)
- Mouse-controlled extension
- Dynamic updates with destruction
- Per-player vision filtering

#### 4.2 Full Sound System
**With real muffling**:
- 3D spatial audio
- Wall occlusion (-50% per wall)
- Movement sounds (3 levels)
- Weapon sounds with variation
- Distance attenuation

**Time**: Full day (feasible with 8 players)

---

### Phase 5: Polish & Effects (Day 5)

#### 5.1 Shaders & Lighting
**Advanced visual features**:
- Dynamic lighting (4x4 blocks)
- Muzzle flashes illuminate
- Explosion glow effects
- CRT filter option
- Bloom and chromatic aberration

#### 5.2 Particle System
**Rich visual feedback**:
- 200+ particles
- Debris from destruction
- Smoke effects
- Spark showers
- Shell casings

**Time**: Full day (pixel art performs great)

---

### Phase 6: Player Systems & UI (Day 6)

#### 6.1 Complete Player Features
**Everything requested**:
- Health system
- Death/respawn
- Full loadout system
- Variable slot support items
- Ammo management

#### 6.2 Polished UI
**Pixel-perfect interface**:
- 5x7 pixel font
- Clear HUD
- Loadout selection
- Scoreboard
- Settings menu

**Time**: Full day

---

### Phase 7: Extra Features & Polish (Day 7)

#### 7.1 Game Modes
**Multiple ways to play**:
- Deathmatch
- Team Deathmatch
- Capture the Flag
- King of the Hill

#### 7.2 Additional Features
**Because we have time**:
- Replay system
- Spectator mode
- Map variants
- Steam integration prep

**Time**: Full day

---

## Critical Path Dependencies

### Can Build in Parallel:
With only 8 players, many systems can be built independently:
1. **Art team**: Create assets while code develops
2. **Sound design**: Build audio while systems develop
3. **Map design**: Create layouts early
4. **UI design**: Mock up interfaces

### Must Be Sequential:
1. Movement → Networking → Weapons
2. Destruction → Vision updates
3. Core → Polish

---

## System Architecture Requirements

### Everything is Simpler:

#### Vision System:
- 480x270 = only 129K pixels to check
- Scanline fill is instant
- 8 viewpoints maximum
- Pre-calculated masks work great

#### Destruction System:
- Bit masks are tiny (128 bytes/wall)
- Network updates are minimal
- Visual variety through overlays
- Shrapnel patterns pre-calculated

#### Movement System:
- 3 states fit in 2 bits
- Pixel-perfect = no float errors
- Prediction is trivial
- Audio triggers are events

#### Weapon System:
- Stats system is standard
- Physics limited by ammo
- Penetration is binary check
- Effects pooling handles all visuals

---

## Performance Expectations

### With Full Features at 480x270:
- **FPS**: 120+ easily
- **Network**: <2 KB/s per player
- **Memory**: <20MB total
- **CPU**: 50% usage max

### This Leaves Room For:
- Advanced shaders
- More particles
- Richer audio
- Background music
- Voice chat
- Recording/streaming

---

## Development Best Practices

### Be Aggressive:
- Build full features first
- Polish later
- Don't pre-optimize
- Trust the performance headroom

### Test Continuously:
- 4v4 matches throughout
- Monitor performance (it'll be fine)
- Get feedback early
- Iterate on feel

### Skip Optimization:
- Pixel art is already optimized
- 8 players is already optimized
- Don't waste time on premature optimization
- Focus on fun

---

## Risk Assessment

### No Real Risks!
With 8 players and pixel art:
- ✅ Performance guaranteed
- ✅ Network bandwidth trivial
- ✅ Memory usage minimal
- ✅ All features achievable

### Only Considerations:
- Art style consistency
- Gameplay balance
- Fun factor
- Polish time

---

## Conclusion

This roadmap delivers your complete original vision in 7 days. The combination of:
- 1v1 to 4v4 gameplay (8 players max)
- 480x270 pixel art
- Modern hardware

Makes everything not just possible but easy. Build aggressively, add features liberally, and ship with confidence!

*This roadmap assumes full-time development. Part-time development should extend timeline proportionally but all features remain achievable.*
