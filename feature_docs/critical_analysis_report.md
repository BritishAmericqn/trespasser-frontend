## REVISED RECOMMENDATIONS

### Original Features to KEEP:
1. ✅ Vision through small holes
2. ✅ 5 vertical slices destruction
3. ✅ Mouse-controlled vision
4. ✅ Real-time sound (simplified)
5. ✅ All weapon types
6. ✅ Complex destruction
7. ✅ Physics projectiles

### Suggested Improvements:
1. Use 480x270 (not 320x180) for readability
2. Add chunky lighting system
3. Include shaders that respect pixels
4. Consider backward running at 70% speed

### No Longer Need to Cut:
- ❌ ~~Sound occlusion~~ → Keep simplified version
- ❌ ~~Complex destruction~~ → Keep as designed
- ❌ ~~Physics limits~~ → Self-limiting with ammo
- ❌ ~~Player count reduction~~ → 8 is perfect

## CONCLUSION - COMPLETE REVERSAL

The move to 1v1-4v4 with pixel art **SOLVES VIRTUALLY EVERY PROBLEM**. 

**Original verdict**: "Extremely ambitious, may be impossible"
**New verdict**: "Completely feasible with massive performance headroom"

### Why Everything Changed:
1. **8 players not 16** = 50% reduction in complexity
2. **Pixel art** = 90% reduction in calculations  
3. **Combined** = 95% reduction in system load

**FINAL RECOMMENDATION**: Build the original vision with confidence. Performance will exceed expectations.
