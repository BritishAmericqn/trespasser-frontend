# Feature Alignment Notes

## Overview
This document confirms that all requested features are supported by the existing documentation and identifies any special considerations.

## Feature Coverage Verification

### CAMERA Features ✓
**Requested Features**:
- Fog-of-war based on surroundings
- Vision through damaged walls (narrow FOV)
- Mouse-controlled extended vision
- Directional FOV

**Documentation Coverage**:
- ✓ **03_fog_of_war_vision.md**: Covers all vision mechanics
- ✓ **07_system_architecture.md**: Vision system data flow
- ✓ Supports dynamic vision updates through destruction

**Special Implementation Notes**:
- The "vertical slice" destruction system perfectly supports narrow FOV through holes
- Mouse-based vision extension requires viewport edge detection

### SOUND Features ✓
**Requested Features**:
- Muffled sound through walls
- Distance-based propagation
- Movement noise levels (quiet walk, walk, run)
- Spatial audio
- Weapon noise levels

**Documentation Coverage**:
- ✓ **01_rendering_movement.md**: Movement system connections to audio
- ✓ **07_system_architecture.md**: Audio system integration points
- ✓ Movement states support different noise levels

**Special Implementation Notes**:
- Three-speed movement system aligns with noise levels
- Material-based audio occlusion supported through destruction system

### MOVEMENT Features ✓
**Requested Features**:
- Slow walk (Ctrl) - quiet, slow
- Normal walk - regular noise/speed
- Run (Shift) - loud, fast, forward-only, no ADS

**Documentation Coverage**:
- ✓ **01_rendering_movement.md**: Movement system architecture
- ✓ **05_weapons_damage.md**: Movement/weapon interactions
- ✓ State machine approach supports multiple movement modes

**Special Implementation Notes**:
- "Forward-only running" requires directional movement restriction
- Movement states integrate with audio and weapon systems

### SHOOTING Features ✓
**Requested Features**:
- ADS vs hip fire mechanics
- Grenade physics (bounce, charge throw)
- Rockets/explosives for destruction
- Detailed weapon stats system
- Penetration mechanics

**Documentation Coverage**:
- ✓ **05_weapons_damage.md**: Complete weapon system design
- ✓ **04_destructible_environments.md**: Explosive damage integration
- ✓ All weapon stats are documented

**Special Implementation Notes**:
- Grenade charge mechanic (hold G) requires input timing system
- Shrapnel effects align with "multiple damage points" in destruction

### MAP Features ✓
**Requested Features**:
- Shadow casting from lights
- Destructible walls with vertical slices
- Material types (HARD/SOFT/INDESTRUCTIBLE)
- Visual degradation
- Penetration based on materials

**Documentation Coverage**:
- ✓ **04_destructible_environments.md**: Vertical slice system explicitly mentioned
- ✓ **06_map_design_management.md**: Map architecture and materials
- ✓ Material system supports all requested types

**Special Implementation Notes**:
- Vertical slices (5 per player width) align perfectly with request
- Progressive visual degradation built into destruction states

### PLAYER Features ✓
**Requested Features**:
- HP system
- Primary/secondary/support loadouts
- Multi-slot support items
- No mid-match weapon swapping
- Reserve ammo per weapon

**Documentation Coverage**:
- ✓ **05_weapons_damage.md**: Player health integration
- ✓ **07_system_architecture.md**: Inventory management systems
- ✓ Loadout system supports all weapon categories

**Special Implementation Notes**:
- "Larger items take multiple slots" requires slot-based inventory
- Grenade throwing (G key) requires dedicated input handling

## Architecture Compatibility

### Vertical Slice Destruction
The documentation's "vertical slice" approach (not tile-based) perfectly matches the requested feature:
- Damage applied where shot lands
- ~5 slices per player width
- Progressive destruction creating openings
- No random hole placement

### Material System Alignment
Documentation materials match exactly:
- **SOFT**: Penetrable, takes damage
- **HARD**: Blocks until destroyed (concrete)
- **INDESTRUCTIBLE**: Map borders

### Network Architecture Support
All features are compatible with the server-authoritative model:
- Movement states synchronized
- Weapon actions validated server-side
- Destruction events broadcast efficiently
- Vision calculated per-client with validation

## Recommended Documentation Updates

While the existing documentation supports all features, consider adding:
1. **Audio System Document**: Dedicated doc for spatial audio and occlusion
2. **Input System Document**: For complex inputs like grenade charging
3. **Inventory System Document**: For loadout and slot management

## Conclusion

All requested features are fully supported by the existing documentation architecture. The vertical slice destruction system, three-speed movement model, comprehensive weapon stats, and material-based systems align perfectly with the feature requirements.

The implementation roadmap (00_feature_implementation_roadmap.md) provides the optimal build order considering all these features and their interdependencies.
