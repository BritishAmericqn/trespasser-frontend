# System Architecture: Feature Interconnections & Data Flow

## Overview
This document illustrates how all game systems interconnect, defining data flow, dependencies, and architectural decisions that enable scalability. Understanding these connections is crucial for maintaining system cohesion and avoiding architectural debt.

## Core Architecture Principles

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Loose Coupling**: Systems communicate through events
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new systems
- **Debugging**: Clear event flow tracking
- **Performance**: Async processing possible

### Authoritative Server Model
- **Security**: Server validates all actions
- **Consistency**: Single source of truth
- **Fairness**: Prevents client manipulation
- **Complexity**: Requires prediction/reconciliation

### Component-Based Design
- **Modularity**: Features as independent components
- **Reusability**: Shared components across entities
- **Flexibility**: Mix-and-match functionality
- **Testing**: Isolated component testing

## Critical Data Flows

### Player Action Flow
```
1. Input System → Client
   - Capture WASD, mouse, actions
   - Timestamp with client time
   
2. Client → Network Layer
   - Compress input state
   - Add sequence number
   - Send to server
   
3. Server Processing
   - Validate input legality
   - Apply to game state
   - Calculate results
   
4. Server → All Clients
   - Broadcast state changes
   - Include timestamp
   - Priority-based sending
   
5. Client Reconciliation
   - Apply server state
   - Reconcile predictions
   - Interpolate visuals
```

### Destruction Event Flow
```
1. Weapon System → Damage Event
   - Calculate damage amount
   - Determine damage type
   - Include source player
   
2. Destruction System Processing
   - Apply damage to tiles
   - Check destruction thresholds
   - Generate debris data
   
3. System Notifications
   → Vision System: Recalculate sight lines
   → Physics System: Update collisions
   → Network System: Broadcast changes
   → Audio System: Play destruction sounds
   → Particle System: Spawn effects
   
4. Client Updates
   - Update visual representation

```

## Inter-System Communication Matrix

| System | Sends To | Receives From | Critical Dependencies |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Movement** | Network, Vision, Audio | Input, Network, Collision | Physics, Map |
| **Networking** | All Systems | All Systems | None (Foundation) |
| **Vision/Fog** | Rendering, Network | Movement, Destruction, Map | Map, Collision |
| **Destruction** | Vision, Physics, Network, Audio, Particles | Weapons, Network | Map, Materials |
| **Weapons** | Destruction, Network, Audio, Visual | Input, Movement, Network | Physics, Player State |
| **Map** | All Systems | Destruction, Editor | Resource Manager |

## State Management Architecture

### Client State
```
ClientState {
  // Authoritative from Server
  - Player positions/health
  - Map destruction state
  - Game score/objectives
  
  // Client-Only
  - Input buffer
  - Prediction state
  - Visual effects
  - UI state
  
  // Hybrid (Predicted + Corrected)
  - Local player position
  - Recent actions
  - Projectile positions
}
```

### Server State
```
ServerState {
  // Core Game State
  - All player states
  - Complete map state
  - Active projectiles
  - Game rules/scoring
  
  // Network Management
  - Client connections
  - Lag compensation data
  - Message queues
  - Interest management
  
  // Performance Optimization
  - Spatial partitions
  - Update priorities
  - Delta compression state
}
```

## Synchronization Strategies

### Eventual Consistency Model
- **Player Position**: Interpolated, corrected
- **Destruction**: Authoritative, permanent
- **Projectiles**: Predicted, validated
- **Vision**: Client-calculated, server-validated

### Update Frequencies
```
High Frequency (Every Frame):
- Local player input
- Visual effects
- UI updates

Medium Frequency (10-30Hz):
- Player positions
- Projectile updates
- Health/ammo

Low Frequency (1-5Hz):
- Map destruction
- Score updates
- Non-critical state

On-Demand:
- Player join/leave
- Major events
- Chat messages
```

## Performance Scaling Architecture

### Horizontal Scaling Points
1. **Multiple Game Servers**: Room-based architecture
2. **Regional Servers**: Geographic distribution
3. **Service Separation**: Auth, game, persistence
4. **Load Balancing**: Smart room assignment

### Vertical Scaling Optimization
1. **Spatial Indexing**: Quadtree for queries
2. **Object Pooling**: Reuse frequent objects
3. **Update Batching**: Group similar updates
4. **LOD Systems**: Reduce distant detail

### Bottleneck Mitigation
```
Common Bottlenecks → Solutions:
- Physics Calculations → Fixed timestep, spatial partitioning
- Network Bandwidth → Delta compression, interest management  
- Destruction Updates → Batch processing, update queuing
- Vision Calculations → Caching, incremental updates
```

## Event System Design

### Event Categories
1. **Immediate**: Combat, death, critical state
2. **Batched**: Movement, minor updates
3. **Delayed**: Effects, non-critical visuals
4. **Reliable**: Score, join/leave, chat
5. **Unreliable**: Particles, sounds, cosmetic

### Event Bus Architecture
```
EventBus {
  // Registration
  - Systems register handlers
  - Priority-based ordering
  - Async/sync options
  
  // Dispatch
  - Type-safe events
  - Automatic queuing
  - Performance monitoring
  
  // Features
  - Event recording
  - Replay capability
  - Debug inspection
}
```

## Security Architecture

### Trust Boundaries
```
Never Trust Client:
- Position (validate reasonable)
- Damage dealt (server calculates)
- Resource amounts (server tracks)
- Visibility (server validates)

Trust Client (With Validation):
- Input commands
- Settings/preferences
- Visual options
```

### Anti-Cheat Layers
1. **Statistical Analysis**: Impossible accuracy/speed
2. **Behavioral Detection**: Inhuman patterns
3. **State Validation**: Impossible positions
4. **Rate Limiting**: Action frequency caps

## Data Persistence Strategy

- Player accounts
- Progression/unlocks
- Match history
- Global statistics

### Caching Strategy

- CDN for static assets
- Client caching for maps
- Server memory for hot data

4. **Edge Cases**: Null checks, bounds validation

### Performance Critical Paths
1. **Input → Movement → Network** (Latency sensitive)
2. **Damage → Destruction → Vision** (CPU intensive)
3. **Network → State → Render** (Every frame)

## Architecture Decision Records

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Server Authoritative**: Security over latency
2. **Event-Driven**: Flexibility over simplicity
3. **Component-Based**: Modularity over performance
4. **Delta Updates**: Bandwidth over complexity

### Trade-offs Accepted
- Prediction complexity for responsiveness
- Memory usage for performance
- Development time for scalability
- Initial complexity for maintainability
