# Feature Documentation: Map Design & Management System

## Overview
The map system forms the foundation of gameplay, defining player movement, tactical options, and destruction possibilities. It must support efficient loading, rendering, collision detection, and dynamic modifications while maintaining consistency across all clients.

## Core Map Architecture

### Map Data Models

#### Tile-Based System
**Grid Structure**
- Fixed-size tiles (e.g., 32x32 units)
- Each tile has properties (material, health, collision)
- **Pros**: Simple, predictable, efficient storage
- **Cons**: Rigid, visible grid, limited shapes
- **Best for**: Strategic games, destructible environments

#### Entity-Based System
**Object Placement**
- Free-form object positioning
- Arbitrary shapes and sizes
- **Pros**: Flexible, realistic layouts
- **Cons**: Complex collision, harder optimization
- **Best for**: Realistic environments

#### Hybrid Approach
**Layered System**
- Tile base with entity decorations
- Best of both worlds
- **Pros**: Efficient with flexibility
- **Cons**: More complex to manage

### Map Data Structure

```
Map Hierarchy:
- Map Metadata (name, size, game modes)
- Layers
  - Background (non-interactive)
  - Collision Layer (walls, obstacles)
  - Destructible Layer (breakable elements)
  - Entity Layer (spawn points, pickups)
  - Trigger Layer (zones, objectives)
- Material Definitions
- Lighting/Vision Data
- Navigation Mesh (if AI present)
```

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

## Map Design Principles

### Flow Design

#### Three-Lane Principle
- Main route plus two alternatives
- Interconnections between lanes
- Risk/reward balance
- Prevents bottlenecks

#### Circular Flow
- No dead ends
- Multiple escape routes
- Encourages movement
- Reduces camping

#### Verticality
- Multiple height levels
- Advantage/disadvantage trade-offs
- Destruction changes vertical access
- Sniper positions with counters

### Balance Considerations

#### Symmetrical Maps
- **Pros**: Inherently balanced
- **Cons**: Can be predictable
- **Use for**: Competitive modes

#### Asymmetrical Maps
- **Pros**: More interesting, realistic
- **Cons**: Harder to balance
- **Use for**: Objective-based modes

### Destruction Integration

#### Strategic Destruction
- Destroying walls opens shortcuts
- Creating new sight lines
- Blocking paths with debris
- Environmental kills

#### Destruction Limits
- Core routes remain viable
- Prevent total map destruction
- Key areas protected
- Regeneration possibilities

## Performance Architecture

### Spatial Partitioning

#### Quadtree/Octree
- Hierarchical space division
- Efficient queries
- Dynamic updates
- Memory efficient

#### Grid-Based Chunks
- Fixed-size regions
- Simple implementation
- Good cache locality
- Easy streaming

### Culling Systems

#### Frustum Culling
- Don't render outside camera
- Per-chunk or per-object
- Essential for performance

#### Occlusion Culling
- Don't render behind walls
- Pre-computed or real-time
- Significant performance gains

### Level of Detail (LOD)

#### Distance-Based LOD
- Simplify far objects
- Reduce texture quality
- Lower polygon count
- Disable small details

#### Importance-Based LOD
- Prioritize player areas
- Simplify inactive zones
- Dynamic adjustment
- Performance scaling

## Map Loading & Streaming
