# Feature Documentation: Destructible Environments System

> **UPDATE FOR 1v1-4v4**: With pixel art at 480x270 and only 8 players, the original vision of 5 vertical slices per player width is completely achievable. Bit-mask storage makes each wall only 128 bytes, and network sync is trivial with so few players.

## Overview
The destructible environment system is a core differentiator that adds tactical depth and dynamic gameplay. It must handle real-time destruction, maintain synchronized state across clients, and integrate seamlessly with vision, physics, and networking systems while maintaining performance.

## Core Destruction Models

### Discrete Tile-Based Destruction
**Grid-Based System**
- Fixed-size tiles with health values
- Binary or multi-state destruction
- **Pros**: Predictable, easier networking, clear boundaries
- **Cons**: Less realistic, visible grid patterns
- **Best for**: Tactical/strategic gameplay

### Continuous Mesh Destruction
**Geometry Deformation**
- Real-time mesh cutting and deformation
- **Pros**: Realistic, dynamic shapes
- **Cons**: Complex implementation, performance heavy
- **Best for**: Physics-focused games

### Hybrid Approach
**Voxel-Based with Visual Polish**
- Underlying voxel/tile system
- Visual smoothing and particle effects
- **Pros**: Balance of performance and visuals
- **Cons**: Additional complexity layer

## Destruction State Management

### Health System Architecture

#### Per-Tile Health Model
```
Each tile has:
- Current Health (0-MaxHealth)
- Material Type (determines MaxHealth)
- Damage Resistance (by damage type)
- Visual State Thresholds
```

#### State Transitions
1. **Pristine**: 100% health
2. **Damaged**: 75% health - visual cracks
3. **Critical**: 25% health - major damage
4. **Destroyed**: 0% health - removed/rubble

### Material System
**Material Properties**
- **Wood**: Low health, burns, cheap to destroy
- **Concrete**: Medium health, creates debris
- **Steel**: High health, requires explosives
- **Glass**: One-hit destroy, shatters
- **Indestructible**: Map boundaries

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: State Desynchronization
- **Problem**: Different destruction states across clients
- **Solution**:
  - Server-authoritative destruction
  - Deterministic damage calculations
  - Periodic state validation
  - Rollback for corrections

### Pitfall 2: Performance Degradation
- **Problem**: Too many destruction calculations/updates
- **Solution**:
  - Batch destruction updates
  - LOD system for distant destruction
  - Limit simultaneous destructions
  - Pre-calculate common scenarios

### Pitfall 3: Memory Bloat
- **Problem**: Tracking every tile's state
- **Solution**:
  - Sparse data structures
  - State compression
  - Only track changed tiles
  - Streaming for large maps

### Pitfall 4: Chain Reaction Crashes
- **Problem**: One destruction triggers cascade
- **Solution**:
  - Limit propagation distance
  - Queue system for updates
  - Frame-rate independent processing
  - Maximum destructions per frame

## Architecture Patterns

### Event-Driven Destruction
```
1. Damage Event → Destruction Manager
2. Validate → Apply Damage → Check Threshold
3. If Destroyed → Broadcast Event
4. Update Systems → Physics, Vision, Network
5. Trigger Effects → Audio, Particles
```

### State Management Patterns

#### Centralized State Manager
- Single source of truth
- All systems query manager
- Easier debugging
- Potential bottleneck

#### Distributed State
- Each tile owns its state
- Systems subscribe to changes
- Better parallelization
- Complex synchronization

### Optimization Strategies

#### Spatial Indexing
- Quadtree/Octree for queries
- Quick area damage lookups
- Efficient neighbor finding
- Dynamic tree rebalancing

#### Level of Detail (LOD)
1. **Near**: Full destruction detail
2. **Medium**: Simplified states
3. **Far**: Binary destroyed/intact
4. **Out of view**: Skip updates

## Performance Considerations

### Update Batching
- Collect frame's destructions
- Process in single pass
- Update dependent systems once
- Reduce redundant calculations

### Memory Optimization
- **Bit Packing**: Store states efficiently
- **Compression**: Run-length encoding
- **Pooling**: Reuse destruction objects
- **Streaming**: Load/unload regions

### Network Optimization
- **Priority Queue**: Important destructions first
- **Delta Compression**: Only send changes
- **Area Updates**: Group nearby destructions
- **Prediction**: Client-side preview

## Visual Representation

1. **Pre-Destruction**: Warning indicators
2. **During**: Progressive damage
3. **Post**: Rubble/debris placement
4. **Settling**: Physics simulation
