# Feature Documentation: Multiplayer Networking System

## Overview
The networking system is the backbone of the multiplayer experience. It must balance security, performance, and player experience while handling unreliable connections, varying latencies, and potential malicious actors.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### Server Authority Model
**Authoritative Server**: The server has final say on all game state
- **Pros**: Cheat prevention, consistent game state, easier debugging
- **Cons**: Input latency, server load, more complex client prediction
- **Alternative**: Peer-to-peer (faster but vulnerable to cheating)

### State Synchronization Strategy

#### Delta Compression
- Only send what changed since last update
- Requires tracking state history
- Dramatically reduces bandwidth
- More complex to implement correctly

#### Snapshot Interpolation
- Send complete snapshots at intervals
- Interpolate between snapshots on client
- Simpler to implement
- Higher bandwidth usage

#### Event-Based Updates
- Send discrete events (player shot, wall destroyed)
- Minimal bandwidth
- Can accumulate errors over time
- Best combined with periodic snapshots

## Critical Design Patterns

### Client-Side Prediction
**Purpose**: Hide latency by immediately showing results of player actions

**Components**:
1. **Input Buffer**: Store recent inputs with timestamps
2. **Prediction Engine**: Apply inputs locally before server confirmation
3. **Reconciliation System**: Correct discrepancies when server state arrives
4. **Rollback Mechanism**: Rewind and replay from authoritative state

### Lag Compensation
**Purpose**: Ensure fair gameplay across different latencies

**Techniques**:
1. **Backward Reconciliation**: Rewind server state to when player acted
2. **Interpolation Delay**: Show smooth movement at cost of slight delay
3. **Extrapolation**: Predict future positions for smoother experience

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Message Ordering Issues
- **Problem**: UDP packets arrive out of order
- **Solution**: Sequence numbers and acknowledgment system
- **Implementation**: Ring buffer for recent messages

### Pitfall 2: Bandwidth Explosion
- **Problem**: Sending full state to all players every frame
- **Solution**: 
  - Interest management (only send nearby data)
  - Update rate limiting
  - Message prioritization

### Pitfall 3: Desync Accumulation
- **Problem**: Small errors compound over time
- **Solution**: 
  - Periodic full state sync
  - Deterministic calculations
  - Fixed-point math for critical values

### Pitfall 4: Connection State Management
- **Problem**: Players disconnect/reconnect frequently
- **Solution**:
  - Grace period before removing player
  - State persistence for reconnection
  - Clear timeout handling

## System Interconnections

### Primary Data Flow

#### Outgoing (Client → Server):
1. **Player Input**
   - Format: Compressed input state + timestamp
   - Frequency: Every frame or batched
   - Priority: Highest

2. **Acknowledgments**
   - Confirm receipt of server updates
   - Used for reliability layer
   - Include highest processed sequence

#### Incoming (Server → Client):
1. **World State Updates**
   - Player positions, velocities
   - Destructible terrain changes
   - Active projectiles
   - Frequency: 10-30Hz typically

2. **Event Broadcasts**
   - Explosions, deaths, respawns
   - Sound triggers
   - Score updates
   - Sent immediately when occur

### Connects TO:
1. **Movement System**
   - Receives: Input commands to relay
   - Sends: Authoritative positions
   - Critical: Timestamp synchronization

2. **Destruction System**
   - Receives: Damage events
   - Sends: Terrain state updates
   - Challenge: Efficient diff encoding

3. **Vision System**
   - Filters: What each player can see
   - Optimization: Don't send invisible data
   - Security: Prevent wallhack exploits

4. **Weapon System**
   - Receives: Fire commands
   - Sends: Hit confirmations
   - Critical: Lag compensation for fairness

### Receives FROM:
1. **Game State Manager**
   - Complete world state
   - Change notifications
   - Priority queues for updates

2. **Physics System**
   - Collision results
   - Movement validation
   - Projectile paths

## Scalability Considerations

### Network Architecture Scaling

#### Message Prioritization System
1. **Critical**: Player deaths, respawns
2. **High**: Player positions, shots fired
3. **Medium**: Terrain destruction
4. **Low**: Particle effects, cosmetic

#### Interest Management
- **Spatial Partitioning**: Grid or quadtree
- **View Distance**: Limit update range
- **Dynamic LOD**: Reduce update frequency for distant objects

### Performance Optimizations

#### Bandwidth Reduction
- **Bit Packing**: Use minimum bits per value
- **Quantization**: Reduce position precision
- **Delta Compression**: Send only changes
- **Huffman Encoding**: For repeated patterns

#### Latency Hiding
- **Client Prediction**: Immediate response
- **Interpolation**: Smooth between updates
- **Extrapolation**: Continue movement patterns

## Key Early Decisions

### Transport Protocol
- **WebSocket (TCP)**: Reliable, ordered, higher latency
- **WebRTC (UDP)**: Fast, unreliable, complex
- **Hybrid**: TCP for critical, UDP for positions

### Update Rate Strategy
- **Fixed Rate**: Predictable, may waste bandwidth
- **Adaptive**: Adjusts to conditions, complex
- **Priority-Based**: Important updates first

### Security Model
- **Validation Level**: What to check server-side
- **Anti-Cheat**: Statistical analysis vs strict validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam attacks

## Implementation Stages

### Phase 1: Basic Connectivity
- Player join/leave
- Simple position sync
- Basic message system

### Phase 2: State Management

- Extreme actions (everyone shooting)
- Geographic distribution

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Key Metrics
- **Round Trip Time (RTT)**: Per player
- **Bandwidth Usage**: In/out per second
- **Update Frequency**: Actual vs target

## Industry Best Practices

### From Successful Games
- **Overwatch**: Favor the shooter, rollback networking
- **Rocket League**: Deterministic physics, input prediction
- **CS:GO**: Lag compensation, tick rate optimization
- **Among Us**: Simple state, hide latency with animations

### Common Patterns
- Send inputs, receive state
- Predict locally, correct authoritatively
- Interpolate between known states
- Prioritize player actions over environment

## Architecture Recommendations

### Message Format
```
Header: [Type][Sequence][Timestamp][Ack]
Payload: [Compressed Game Data]
```

### State Structure
- Separate reliable and unreliable channels
- Version your protocol
- Plan for backward compatibility
- Use fixed-size buffers where possible

## Future Considerations
- Rollback netcode for fighting game feel
- Dedicated server vs player hosting
- Regional server distribution
- Spectator mode support
- Replay system architecture
