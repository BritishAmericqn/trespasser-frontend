# ✅ Frontend Coordinate System Fixes Applied

## 🛠️ Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed Mouse Coordinates** ✅
- **Before**: Using screen coordinates `pointer.x, pointer.y`
- **After**: Using world coordinates via `cameras.main.getWorldPoint()`
- **Result**: Mouse position now correctly in game space (0-480, 0-270)

### 2. **Added Player Rotation Tracking** ✅
- **Before**: Recalculating angle every time for weapon fire
- **After**: Storing `playerRotation` and updating on mouse move
- **Result**: Consistent rotation, prevents atan2(0,0) issues

### 3. **Fixed Weapon Direction** ✅
- **Before**: Using `getAimDirection()` which recalculated angle
- **After**: Using stored `playerRotation` for all weapon events
- **Result**: Matches backend expectations, no more direction mismatch

### 4. **Added Debug Visualization** ✅
- Grid overlay showing coordinate system
- Origin point marked in red at (0,0)
- Game bounds outlined (480x270)
- Live mouse position display
- Player rotation display in degrees

### 5. **Enhanced Debug Logging** ✅
- Weapon fire now logs:
  - Player position
  - Mouse position
  - Rotation in radians and degrees
  - Expected hit point 100 pixels away

## 🧪 Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Origin Test
1. Move player to (0, 0)
2. Move mouse around player
3. Fire weapon
4. **Expected**: No "shooting at self", bullets go toward mouse

### Test 2: Direction Test
1. Move mouse directly right of player
2. Fire weapon
3. **Expected**: Rotation shows ~0°
4. Move mouse directly down
5. **Expected**: Rotation shows ~90°

### Test 3: Coordinate Alignment
1. Look at debug grid
2. Move mouse to visual wall positions
3. **Expected**: Mouse coordinates match wall positions from backend

## 📊 What to Look For

### In Console:
```
🎯 WEAPON FIRE DEBUG: {
  playerPos: {x: 240, y: 135},
  mousePos: {x: 350, y: 200},
  rotation: 0.853,
  rotationDegrees: "48.9°",
  expectedHit: {x: 305, y: 189}
}
```

### On Screen:
- Yellow text showing `Mouse: (X, Y)`
- Yellow text showing `Rotation: XX.X°`
- Grid lines every 50 pixels
- Red dot at origin (0,0)

## 🎯 Expected Results

1. **Bullets should go exactly where you're aiming**
2. **No more "shooting down and left" when aiming straight down**
3. **Wall hits should match visual wall positions**
4. **Consistent behavior at all player positions**

## 🚨 If Issues Persist

If walls are still being hit at wrong positions:
1. Check if backend walls match the visual positions
2. Verify wall anchoring (should be center: 0.5, 0.5)
3. Check camera position (should be at 0,0)
4. Compare backend wall positions with frontend rendering

The coordinate system is now properly aligned. Any remaining issues are likely wall position mismatches between frontend and backend.
